# Context

Your business and product knowledge — the source of truth for goals, strategy, users, and competitive landscape.

## Files

Fill these in (see SETUP.md for guidance):

- **business-overview.md** — Company basics, mission, value proposition
- **users-personas.md** — Target users and personas
- **products-services.md** — Product portfolio and offerings
- **business-model.md** — How you make money
- **goals-strategy.md** — Strategic direction, OKRs, alignment (used by quarter-plan and week-plan)
- **competitive-landscape.md** — Competitors and market positioning

When you finalize projects that update context, previous versions are archived to `context/_history/`.
