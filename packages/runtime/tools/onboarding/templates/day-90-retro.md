## Context Mastery

Which context files are complete and accurate? Which still need work?

| Context File | Status | Confidence |
|-------------|--------|-----------|

## What Worked Well

Things that made your onboarding successful:

- [e.g., "Sharing my 30/60/90 plan with the team in week 2 — got great feedback and built trust"]
- [e.g., "The 9 Magic Words opened every relationship"]
- [e.g., "Diagnosing burning problems in Phase 1 gave me credibility for Phase 2 quick wins"]

---

## What I'd Do Differently

If you were starting over, what would you change?

- [e.g., "Would have shadowed customer calls earlier — waited until week 3 but should have started week 1"]
- [e.g., "Spent too much time reading docs and not enough talking to people in week 1-2"]

---

## 6-Month Vision

Where are you headed post-onboarding? What's your focus for the next quarter?

**Primary focus area**: [What you'll own and drive]

**Key goals (next 90 days)**:
1. [Goal 1 — specific, measurable]
2. [Goal 2]
3. [Goal 3]

**Relationships to invest in long-term**:
