# Onboarding Playbook

This is your guide to thriving in a new role. Read it in your first few days, then reference it as you move through each phase. The goal isn't just to survive onboarding — it's to set yourself up for long-term success.

Onboarding happens in three phases:

1. **Learn** (Days 1-30) — Build deep understanding
2. **Contribute** (Days 31-60) — Start adding value
3. **Lead** (Days 61-90) — Own something meaningful

Each phase builds on the last. Don't skip ahead.

## Universal Principles

These apply throughout your entire onboarding — from day one through day 90 and beyond.

### 1. Relationships Are the Job

Product management is influence work, not authority work. You rarely have direct authority over the people you need to get things done — engineering, design, marketing, sales. Your effectiveness comes from relationships, trust, and credibility.

This means relationships aren't separate from "the work" — they **are** the work. Every conversation, every commitment kept, every interaction is either building trust or eroding it. Start building relationships before you need them. The best time to form a connection is before you have a request to make.

Every interaction charges or drains your trust battery. Make deposits early and often — small acts of helpfulness, reliability, and follow-through compound over time.

### 2. Listen More Than Talk

Your listening-to-talking ratio should evolve as you gain context:

- **Month 1 (Days 1-30): 80/20** — Listen 80%, talk 20%. Your job is to absorb, not to prescribe. Ask questions, take notes, resist the urge to add value through suggestions.
- **Month 2 (Days 31-60): 70/30** — You're starting to contribute, but you're still learning. Listen more than you talk, but start sharing observations and asking strategic questions.
- **Month 3 (Days 61-90): 50/50** — You've earned the right to be a balanced contributor. Your perspective is valuable now because it's grounded in context.

The fresh-eyes window is short. Use your beginner's mind to ask the questions others have stopped asking, but don't mistake newness for insight. Listen first, contribute second.

### 3. Share Your Plan Widely

Don't just share your plan with your manager — share it with your team, your cross-functional partners, and key stakeholders.

- **Transparency builds trust** — People see you're intentional about ramping up
- **Surfaces blind spots early** — Others will spot gaps you can't see yet
- **Invites collaboration** — Stakeholders can suggest who to meet, what to read
- **Creates accountability** — When your plan is visible, you're more likely to follow through

Share it in week 1 or 2, before you're too invested. Invite feedback: "Here's what I'm thinking. What am I missing?"

### 4. Be a Sponge, Not a Know-It-All

You were hired for your expertise, but resist the urge to prove it too early. Context matters. Every company has reasons for their current state — constraints you don't see, history you don't know, trade-offs you don't understand yet.

Ask "**Why did you do it that way?**" before "**Have you considered...?**"

When you understand the why, you can propose better solutions that respect the context. Or you might discover the "obvious fix" was already tried.

Be a sponge first. Absorb the culture, the constraints, the history. Once you understand deeply, then you can suggest meaningfully.

### 5. Seek Feedback Early

Don't wait for formal reviews to ask how you're doing. Create a feedback loop:

- **Week 2**: "How am I doing so far? Any early feedback?"
- **Week 4**: "What's one thing I could be doing better?"
- **Week 6**: "Am I focusing on the right things?"
- **Week 8**: "How can I be more effective?"

When you receive feedback, close the loop. Report back on what you adjusted. People will give you more feedback when they see you act on it.

### 6. Because vs Despite

Most businesses thrive **despite** problems, not because everything is perfect. Your fresh eyes will see inefficiencies immediately. Resist the urge to fix everything.

Ask: "**Is this company successful because of this, or despite this?**"

If they're thriving despite the problem, it might not be the right battle. Some problems are load-bearing — removing them creates bigger problems. Some are just annoying but low-impact.

Choose your battles wisely. You have limited credibility and energy. Spend them on things that matter.

## Phase 1: Learn (Days 1-30)

**Your mindset**: Curiosity over contribution. Your job is to absorb, not to fix.

### Two Traps to Avoid

**The Documentation Hole**: Spending weeks reading documentation without talking to people. Context lives in conversations, not wikis. Documentation is a starting point, not the full picture. Balance reading with relationship-building from day one.

**Coming In Hot**: Proposing solutions before you understand the problem space. Your fresh perspective is valuable, but only after you've earned the context to wield it.

### How to Position Yourself

You're a newcomer, and that's a strength. Your fresh eyes see things others have stopped seeing. Use this window to:

- **Survey broadly before specializing** — Touch every part of the business, product, and team before deep-diving
- **Capture observations** — Write down what surprises you, what seems obvious but isn't documented, what feels harder than it should be
- **Ask the "dumb" questions** — The questions that seem too basic often reveal the most

### The 9 Magic Words

In every 1:1, ask: **"What can I do to make your life easier?"**

This opens doors and builds relationships faster than anything else. It signals you're there to help, not just to extract information.

### Burning Problems

Ask your manager, eng lead, and design lead: "**Is there a burning problem I can investigate and diagnose?**" Not solve — investigate. Aim for 2-3 problems.

Deeply understanding a burning problem proves you can think critically. You'll learn more diagnosing one real problem than reading ten docs.

### Questions to Answer

By day 30, you should be able to answer:

- What problem does the company solve? For whom?
- What's the business model? How does money flow?
- Who are the key customers/users? What do they care about?
- What's the product strategy? Where is it headed?
- Who are the key people you need relationships with?
- What are the current priorities and why?
- What's working well? What's not?

### Phase 1 Complete When

- You can explain the business to someone new
- You've met with all key stakeholders at least once
- You have a clear picture of current priorities
- You've held a situational conversation with your manager — playing back what you've learned

---

## Phase 2: Contribute (Days 31-60)

**Your mindset**: Helpful contributor. Look for ways to add value without overreaching.

### Quick Wins

Your first 30 days built understanding. Now prove you can deliver. Quick wins bridge observation and ownership — they build credibility for bigger initiatives.

**What makes a good quick win:**

- **Fast** — Completable in 2-3 weeks
- **Visible** — Others see the impact
- **Low-risk** — Won't break things if you're still learning
- **Unowned** — Nobody else is already working on it

**Examples:**

- Demo the product internally (proves you understand it)
- Run a retro on a recent release (outsider perspective is an asset)
- Fix a small visible problem hiding in plain sight
- Create or improve a recurring artifact (better PRD template, status format)

### The Trust Battery

Trust isn't binary — it's a battery that charges or drains with every interaction. You start with a neutral charge. Every commitment kept charges it. Every missed commitment drains it.

**How to charge it:**

- **Make small commitments and keep them** — "I'll send that by Friday" → send it Thursday
- **Track your Say/Do Ratio** — What you say you'll do vs what you actually do. 100% is the goal.
- **Make progress visible** — Share what you're working on, even if it's not done
- **Deliver incrementally** — Don't disappear for 3 weeks. Share drafts early, iterate publicly.

### Navigating Imposter Syndrome

If you're feeling "I don't know what I'm doing" or "They're going to figure out I don't belong" — welcome to the club. It's nearly universal in new roles.

You're not supposed to know everything yet. You're 30-60 days in. What you're supposed to do:

- Ask good questions (you're doing this)
- Learn quickly (you're doing this)
- Deliver on small commitments (this is what Phase 2 is for)
- Show up consistently (keep showing up)

Focus on contribution, not perfection. Give yourself permission to be a beginner who's learning fast.

### Phase 2 Complete When

- You've delivered at least one meaningful contribution
- Key stakeholders see you as helpful and competent
- You have a clear target for what you'll own in Phase 3

---

## Phase 3: Lead (Days 61-90)

**Your mindset**: Confident owner. You've earned the right to lead.

### Navigate Sacred Cows

You've been here 60 days. You see inefficiencies, legacy decisions, processes that don't make sense. Before you charge in:

**Talk to the people who built them.** Ask: "Help me understand the context when this was created. What problem were you solving?"

You'll often discover the "obvious fix" was already tried, or there's a constraint you don't see. Earn the right to challenge by first demonstrating you understand.

Instead of "What's broken?" ask "**What's working, and how do we do more of it?**" This changes you from critic to collaborator.

### Peacetime vs Wartime

Not all contexts are the same:

- **Peacetime** — Optimizing, growing steadily. Rewards consensus-building, stakeholder alignment, thoughtful process.
- **Wartime** — Survival mode, urgent pivots. Rewards bias to action, speed, decisive moves.

Ask your manager: "**What mode are we in right now? What does that mean for how I should operate?**" If you're building consensus in wartime, you'll be seen as slow. If you're moving unilaterally in peacetime, you'll be seen as reckless.

### Share Your POV

By day 60, you've earned the right to have opinions. But how you share them matters:

- **Back it with evidence** — "In the last 5 customer calls, 3 mentioned [pain point]" beats "I think we should..."
- **Frame as hypothesis** — "I'm thinking we should do X because [reasoning]. What am I missing?"
- **Invite challenge** — "What would change your mind?" or "What am I not seeing?"

You're opening a conversation, not closing one.

### Phase 3 Complete When

- You've successfully led at least one initiative
- People seek you out for your expertise
- You feel confident operating independently
- You have a clear vision for your ongoing focus

## Landmines to Avoid

Common mistakes that derail onboarding:

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | What to Do Instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Dumping user feedback list in week 1 | You don't understand context yet | Synthesize patterns after 30 days of listening |
| Assigning action items in early 1:1s | You haven't earned trust yet | Ask questions, offer help, listen first |
| Making proclamations before understanding | Erodes credibility fast | Ask "Why?" before suggesting changes |
| Trying to fix everything you see | Overwhelms you and the team | Choose 1-2 high-impact quick wins |
| Projecting previous company playbook | Every company is different | Observe, adapt, then apply lessons |
| Ignoring informal power structure | Formal org chart ≠ real influence | Map who people actually go to |

## Areté Skills for Onboarding

Use these at the right moments:

| When | Ask for | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Each morning | "Plan my day" | Plan your day with focus areas and priorities |
| Before meetings | "Prep me for my meeting with [name]" | Build a brief with attendee context and history |
| After meetings | "Process my meetings" | Extract decisions, action items, update people files |
| Week 2-3 | "Help me understand the competitive landscape" | Research competitors to build context |
| Phase 2+ | "Help me write a PRD" | Document your first initiative |
