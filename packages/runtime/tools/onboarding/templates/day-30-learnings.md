## Gaps in My Understanding

Things I still don't know or need to validate before moving to Phase 2:

- [ ] [Gap 1 — e.g., "I don't fully understand why we chose X architecture over Y"]
- [ ] [Gap 2 — e.g., "I haven't talked to customers directly yet"]
- [ ] [Gap 3]

## Questions for Validation

Questions to confirm my understanding is correct. Ask these in the situational conversation:

1. [e.g., "My understanding is that our primary growth lever is X — is that right?"]
2. [e.g., "It seems like the team values Y over Z when making trade-offs — am I reading that correctly?"]
3. [e.g., "I'm seeing a pattern of W in customer feedback — is that a known issue?"]

## Burning Problems Status

Reference your `working/working-tracker.md` — summarize where each problem investigation stands:

| Problem | Status | Key Finding So Far |
|---------|--------|--------------------|
| [From working tracker] | [Investigating / Diagnosed / Need more data] | [Brief summary] |
| | | |

---

## Key Relationships Built

Reference your `people/` files — who have you connected with and how strong are those relationships?

| Person | Relationship Status | Key Insight From Them |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| [Name → `people/[slug].md`] | [Strong / Building / Initial] | [What you learned from them] |
| | | |
