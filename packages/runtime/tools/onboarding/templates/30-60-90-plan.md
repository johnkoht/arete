## Risks and Watch-Outs

Identify risks specific to your onboarding situation. Use these categories as a starting point — customize based on your role, company, and context.

| Category | Risk | Mitigation | Watch-For Signals |
|----------|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Role Scope** | [e.g., Scope expands before you have credibility to push back] | [e.g., Align with manager on explicit boundaries in week 1-2] | [e.g., Being pulled into projects outside your stated scope before day 30] |
| **Role Scope** | [e.g., Unclear ownership boundaries with existing team members] | [e.g., Map ownership explicitly with manager and peers in 1:1s] | [e.g., Duplicate work or territorial friction] |
| **Technical/Domain** | [e.g., Domain complexity requires deeper ramp than 30 days] | [e.g., Identify domain mentors early; front-load technical learning] | [e.g., Still unable to follow technical discussions by week 3-4] |
| **Relationship** | [e.g., Key stakeholder is disengaged or skeptical of new hire] | [e.g., Ask manager for context on relationship dynamics; use 9 Magic Words] | [e.g., Cancelled 1:1s, short responses, exclusion from meetings] |
| **Pace/Burnout** | [e.g., Drinking from the firehose — too much context, too fast] | [e.g., Time-box learning sessions; prioritize breadth over depth in Phase 1] | [e.g., Feeling overwhelmed by week 2; unable to synthesize learnings] |
