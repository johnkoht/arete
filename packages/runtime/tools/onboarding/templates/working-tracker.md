# Working Tracker

This file tracks your active thinking work during onboarding. Update it as you learn, discover problems, and identify opportunities. Sections activate by phase — start with Learning Backlog and Burning Problems in Phase 1, then add Quick Wins in Phase 2.

## Learning Backlog (Phase 1)

Track what you need to learn and how you'll learn it. Prioritize learning and identify mentors early. Update weekly as new gaps emerge.

### PM Craft

| What do I need to learn? | Why? | Who can teach me? | How will I get it? |
|--------------------------|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [e.g., How decisions get made here — formal vs informal process] | [Need to know how to get things approved] | [Manager, tenured PM] | [1:1 conversations, observe decision meetings] |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Product

| What do I need to learn? | Why? | Who can teach me? | How will I get it? |
|--------------------------|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [e.g., Core product architecture and key technical constraints] | [Need to scope features realistically] | [Engineering lead, senior engineers] | [Architecture walkthrough, read technical docs] |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Market

| What do I need to learn? | Why? | Who can teach me? | How will I get it? |
|--------------------------|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [e.g., Competitive landscape and how we differentiate] | [Need to position features and make strategic trade-offs] | [Marketing, sales, founder/CEO] | [Competitive analysis, win/loss reviews, sales calls] |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Business

| What do I need to learn? | Why? | Who can teach me? | How will I get it? |
|--------------------------|------|--------------------|--------------------|

| | | | |
| | | | |

## Burning Problems (Phase 1)

Ask your manager, eng lead, and design lead: **"Is there a burning problem I can investigate and diagnose (not solve)?"** Aim for 2-3 problems. Track your investigation here — the goal is to deeply understand the problem, not to fix it yet.

| Problem | Flagged By | Investigation Notes | Diagnosis | Recommendation Timing |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| [e.g., Customer churn spike in segment X] | [Manager] | [Talked to 3 customers, reviewed support tickets, analyzed usage data...] | [Root cause: onboarding flow drops off at step 3 due to...] | [Share at week 4 check-in with manager] |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

## Quick Wins (Phase 2)

Identify opportunities that meet all four criteria: **Fast** (2-3 weeks), **Visible** (others see impact), **Low-risk** (won't break things), **Unowned** (nobody else is working on it). Quick wins charge your trust battery and earn credibility for bigger initiatives.

| Opportunity | Effort (days) | Visibility | Risk | Owner Status | Criteria Met? |
|------------|--------------|-----------|------|-------------|---------------|
| [e.g., Fix confusing error message in onboarding flow] | [3 days] | [High — all new users see it] | [Low — copy change only] | [Unowned — nobody assigned] | [✓ Fast, ✓ Visible, ✓ Low-risk, ✓ Unowned] |
