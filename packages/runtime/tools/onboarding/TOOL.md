# Onboarding Tool

A structured approach to starting a new job with excellence. This tool helps you move from newcomer to established contributor through three phases: Learn, Contribute, and Lead. It's designed to help you build genuine understanding, establish credibility, form real relationships, and set yourself up for long-term success.

> **Areté in Action**: The goal isn't just to survive onboarding—it's to thrive. This tool helps you pursue excellence from day one.

## When to Use

- "I'm starting a new job"
- "Start onboarding tool"
- "Help me with my 30/60/90 day plan"
- "I want to onboard effectively"
- "New role, help me ramp up"

## When NOT to Use

- You've been in the role for 90+ days already
- You're doing a lateral move within the same team
- You just need a quick checklist (use a simple task list instead)

## Scope Options

### Comprehensive (Default)

Full 90-day structured onboarding with deep context-building.

- Complete 30/60/90 day plan with detailed first 30 days
- Weekly planning and check-ins
- Full context file population
- Stakeholder mapping and relationship building
- 1:1 tracking and synthesis
- Documented wins and learnings

**Best for**: New company, new domain, leadership roles, or when you want maximum support.

### Streamlined

Focused 30-day plan with essential tracking.

- 30-day detailed plan only
- Bi-weekly check-ins
- Core context files only (business overview, products, users)
- Key stakeholder identification
- Light 1:1 tracking

**Best for**: Similar domain, familiar company type, or when you're already confident in your onboarding abilities.

## The Three Phases

## Universal Principles (All Phases)

These principles apply throughout your entire onboarding journey. They're not phase-specific—they're foundational approaches that will serve you from day one through day 90 and beyond.

#### 1. Relationships Are the Job

Product management is influence work, not authority work. You rarely have direct authority over the people you need to get things done—engineering, design, marketing, sales. Your effectiveness comes from relationships, trust, and credibility.

This means relationships aren't separate from "the work"—they **are** the work. Every conversation, every commitment kept, every interaction is either building trust or eroding it. Start building relationships before you need them. The best time to form a connection is before you have a request to make.

Remember: every interaction charges or drains the trust battery (see Phase 2). Make deposits early and often—small acts of helpfulness, reliability, and follow-through compound over time.

#### 2. Listen More Than Talk

Your listening-to-talking ratio should evolve as you gain context and credibility:

- **Month 1 (Days 1-30): 80/20 ratio** — Listen 80%, talk 20%. Your job is to absorb, not to prescribe. Ask questions, take notes, resist the urge to add value through suggestions.
- **Month 2 (Days 31-60): 70/30 ratio** — You're starting to contribute, but you're still learning. Listen more than you talk, but start sharing observations and asking strategic questions.
- **Month 3 (Days 61-90): 50/50 ratio** — You've earned the right to be a balanced contributor. Listen and speak equally. Your perspective is valuable now because it's grounded in context.

The fresh-eyes window is short. Use your beginner's mind to ask the questions others have stopped asking, but don't mistake newness for insight. Listen first, contribute second.

#### 3. Share Your Plan Widely

Don't just share your 30/60/90 plan with your manager—share it with your team, your cross-functional partners, and key stakeholders. Deb Liu (Meta, Ancestry) advocates for publishing your onboarding plan openly because:

- **Transparency builds trust** — People see you're intentional about ramping up, not winging it
- **Surfaces blind spots early** — Others will spot gaps or misunderstandings in your plan that you can't see yet
- **Invites collaboration** — Stakeholders can suggest who to meet, what to read, what matters most
- **Creates accountability** — When your plan is visible, you're more likely to follow through

Share your plan in week 1 or 2, before you're too invested in it. Invite feedback: "Here's what I'm thinking. What am I missing?" Let others shape your approach while you're still flexible.

#### 4. Be a Sponge, Not a Know-It-All

You were hired for your expertise, but resist the urge to prove it too early. Context matters. Every company has reasons for their current state—constraints you don't see, history you don't know, trade-offs you don't understand yet.

Before you propose solutions, earn the right to challenge through curiosity and understanding. Ask "**Why did you do it that way?**" before "**Have you considered...?**" When you understand the why, you can propose better solutions that respect the context. Or you might discover the "obvious fix" was already tried.

Your fresh perspective is valuable, but only after you've built the context to wield it effectively. Be a sponge first. Absorb the culture, the constraints, the history. Once you understand deeply, then you can suggest meaningfully.

#### 5. Seek Feedback Early

Vulnerability builds trust. Don't wait for formal 30/60/90 reviews to ask how you're doing. Create a feedback loop by asking early and often:

- **Week 2**: "How am I doing so far? Any early feedback?"
- **Week 4**: "What's one thing I could be doing better?"
- **Week 6**: "Am I focusing on the right things?"
- **Week 8**: "How can I be more effective?"

This does two things: First, it signals humility and openness to learning. Second, it gives you time to course-correct before small issues become big problems.

When you receive feedback, close the loop. Report back on what you adjusted based on their input. This shows you're coachable and that their feedback matters. People will give you more feedback when they see you act on it.

#### 6. "Because vs Despite"

Most businesses thrive **despite** problems, not because everything is perfect. Every company has dysfunctions, legacy decisions, and inefficiencies. Your fresh eyes will see them immediately. Resist the urge to fix everything.

Instead, ask: **"Is this company successful because of this, or despite this?"**

If the company is thriving **despite** the problem, it might not be the right battle to fight. Save your energy for what multiplies impact, not what's merely broken.

Not every dysfunction is worth fixing. Some problems are load-bearing—they exist because removing them would create bigger problems. Some are just annoying but low-impact. Focus on what matters: what unlocks growth, removes critical blockers, or multiplies your team's effectiveness.

Choose your battles wisely. You have limited credibility and energy. Spend them on things that matter.

---

### Phase 1: Learn (Days 1-30)

**Goal**: Build deep understanding of the business, product, users, and team

**Mindset**: Curiosity over contribution. Your job is to absorb, not to fix.

#### Two Traps to Avoid

Before diving into activities, be aware of two common pitfalls:

1. **The Documentation Hole**: Spending weeks reading documentation without talking to people. Context lives in conversations, not wikis. Documentation is a starting point, not the full picture. Balance reading with relationship-building from day one.

2. **Coming In Hot**: Proposing solutions in weeks 1-2 before you understand the problem space. Resist the urge to "add value" through suggestions too early. Your fresh perspective is valuable, but only after you've earned the context to wield it effectively.

#### Key Activities

- [ ] Schedule **walking 1:1s** (not sitting ones) with key stakeholders (manager, peers, cross-functional partners)
- [ ] Use **The 9 Magic Words** in every 1:1: "What can I do to make your life easier?" — This opens doors and builds relationships faster than any other question
- [ ] Ask your manager, eng lead, and design lead: **"Is there a burning problem I can investigate and diagnose?"** (not solve) — Aim for 2-3 problems to deeply understand
- [ ] Read all available documentation (PRDs, strategy docs, wikis) — but don't fall into the documentation hole
- [ ] Shadow customer calls or review recordings
- [ ] Understand the product deeply (use it, break it, question it)
- [ ] Map the organization and decision-making processes
- [ ] Identify the "unwritten rules" and cultural norms
- [ ] **Document as you learn** — Create data dictionaries, process maps, and guides as you understand them. Triple benefit: deepens your learning, creates a reference for your future self, and provides leverage for the team

#### Breadth Over Depth

During your first 30 days, resist the temptation to dive deep into rabbit holes. You have a **fresh eyes window** — a limited time when your beginner's mind reveals opportunities, dysfunctions, and questions that others have stopped seeing. Use this window wisely:

- **Survey broadly before specializing** — Touch every part of the business, product, and team before deep-diving any one area
- **Capture fresh observations** — Write down what surprises you, what seems obvious but isn't documented, what feels harder than it should be
- **"Because vs Despite" lens** — Businesses thrive **despite** problems, not because everything is perfect. Observe what's working and why, not just what's broken. This lens helps you choose your battles wisely.

**Questions to Answer**:
- What problem does the company solve? For whom?
- What's the business model? How does money flow?
- Who are the key customers/users? What do they care about?
- What's the product strategy? Where is it headed?
- Who are the key people I need relationships with?
- What are the current priorities and why?
- What's working well? What's not?

**Outputs**:
- Draft context files (business overview, products, users, competitive landscape)
- Stakeholder map with relationship status
- List of open questions to resolve
- Initial observations and insights

**Phase Complete When**:
- You can explain the business to someone new
- You've met with all key stakeholders at least once
- Draft context files exist for core areas
- You have a clear picture of current priorities
- **You've held a situational conversation with your manager** — You can play back what you've learned and validate your understanding ("Here's what I understand about our strategy/customers/priorities. What am I missing?")

---

### Phase 2: Contribute (Days 31-60)

**Goal**: Start adding value while continuing to deepen understanding

**Mindset**: Helpful contributor. Look for ways to add value without overreaching.

#### Quick Win Finder

Your first 30 days built understanding. Now it's time to prove you can deliver. Quick wins are the bridge between observation and ownership—they build your trust battery and earn you credibility for bigger initiatives.

**What makes a good quick win?**

- **Fast**: Completable in 2-3 weeks (not months)
- **Visible**: Others see the impact (not invisible infrastructure)
- **Low-risk**: Won't break critical systems if you're still learning
- **Unowned**: Nobody else is already working on it (unclaimed territory)

**Why quick wins matter**: Every small commitment you deliver charges your trust battery. Quick wins prove competence, demonstrate your ability to ship, and earn you the credibility to tackle bigger problems later. They're not just tasks—they're trust-building exercises.

**Tactical Quick Win Examples**:

- **Demo the product internally** — Build a presentation or workshop that showcases the product to new employees or other teams. Proves you understand it deeply by weeks 4-6.
- **Run a retro on a recent release** — Your outsider perspective is an asset here. Ask the "dumb" questions about what worked and what didn't. Team gets insights, you get context.
- **Fix a small visible problem hiding in plain sight** — That annoying onboarding flow bug? The confusing error message? The outdated screenshot in docs? Small fixes with visible impact.
- **Audit an existing workflow for low-hanging fruit** — Review a conversion funnel, user onboarding flow, or internal process. Identify 3-5 quick improvements with minimal engineering lift.
- **Create or improve a recurring artifact** — Design a better template for PRDs, status updates, roadmap formats, or sprint planning. Something the team will use repeatedly.

#### Trust Battery

Trust isn't binary—it's not "trusted" vs "untrusted." It's a battery that charges (or drains) with every interaction. You start your new role with a neutral battery. Every commitment kept, every deadline met, every "I'll follow up" that actually gets followed up—these charge the battery. Every missed commitment, every overpromise, every "I'll get back to you" that never happens—these drain it.

**How to charge your trust battery:**

- **Make small commitments and keep them** — "I'll send you that doc by Friday" → send it Thursday. Trust grows through consistency, not grand gestures.
- **Track your Say/Do Ratio** — What you say you'll do vs what you actually do. A 100% Say/Do Ratio is the fastest way to build credibility. Keep a running list in your notes: commitments made → commitments delivered.
- **Make progress visible** — Share what you're working on, even if it's not done. "Here's what I'm thinking so far" invites feedback and shows you're moving forward.
- **Deliver incrementally** — Don't disappear for 3 weeks and emerge with a finished artifact. Share drafts early, get feedback often, iterate publicly.

#### Navigating Imposter Syndrome

If you're feeling some version of "I don't know what I'm doing" or "They're going to figure out I don't belong here"—welcome to the club. Imposter syndrome is nearly universal in new roles, especially high-performing ones. Here's the truth: your fresh perspective is valuable, not a liability.

You're not supposed to know everything yet. You're 30-60 days in. What you're supposed to do is:
- Ask good questions (you're doing this)
- Learn quickly (you're doing this)
- Deliver on small commitments (this is what Phase 2 is for)
- Show up consistently (keep showing up)

Focus on contribution, not perfection. Nobody expects you to be the expert yet. They expect you to be curious, reliable, and helpful. You're already doing the work—now give yourself permission to be a beginner who's learning fast.

**Key Activities**:
- [ ] Join active projects in a supporting role
- [ ] Take on small, well-scoped tasks and deliver them well
- [ ] Deepen relationships with key stakeholders (second 1:1s)
- [ ] Start sharing observations and asking strategic questions
- [ ] Identify one area where you can make a meaningful contribution
- [ ] Refine context files based on deeper understanding
- [ ] Document your first "win" (however small)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Where can I add the most value given my skills?
- What problems exist that I'm uniquely positioned to help with?
- Who are my allies and potential collaborators?
- What does success look like in this role?
- What are the unstated expectations?

**Outputs**:
- At least one documented win/contribution
- Refined context files
- Deeper stakeholder relationships
- Identified opportunity area for Phase 3

**Phase Complete When**:
- You've delivered at least one meaningful contribution
- Key stakeholders see you as helpful and competent
- You have a clear target for what you'll own in Phase 3
- Context files are mostly complete

---

### Phase 3: Lead (Days 61-90)

**Goal**: Own something meaningful and establish your presence

**Mindset**: Confident owner. You've earned the right to lead.

#### Navigate Sacred Cows

You've been here 60 days. You see inefficiencies, legacy decisions, and processes that don't make sense. Before you charge in to fix them, slow down. Most "obvious problems" exist for reasons you don't yet understand. The person who built what you want to change had context you don't have yet.

**Reframe your approach:**

Instead of asking "What's broken?" ask "**What's working, and how do we do more of it?**" This subtle shift changes you from critic to collaborator. It opens doors instead of closing them.

**Know-Why-Before-How:**

Before proposing changes to existing systems, processes, or decisions, **talk to the people who built them**. Ask: "Help me understand the context when this was created. What problem were you solving?" You'll often discover the "obvious fix" was already tried, or the constraint you don't see is what drove the original decision.

Earn the right to challenge by first demonstrating you understand. Once you understand the why, you can propose better solutions that respect the context. Or you might discover the sacred cow isn't actually sacred—it's just legacy that everyone forgot to revisit.

#### Peacetime vs Wartime Context

Not all organizational contexts are the same. Some companies are in **peacetime** (optimizing, growing steadily, building for the long term). Others are in **wartime** (survival mode, existential threat, urgent pivots required).

**Why this matters:**

- **Peacetime** rewards consensus-building, stakeholder alignment, and thoughtful process. Take time to get buy-in. Build coalitions. Document decisions.
- **Wartime** rewards bias to action, speed, and decisive moves. Consensus is a luxury you might not have. Move fast, course-correct as you go.

**How to know which mode you're in:**

Ask your manager or a trusted peer: "**What mode are we in right now? What does that mean for how I should operate?**" The answer will shape your approach. If you're building consensus in wartime, you'll be seen as slow. If you're moving unilaterally in peacetime, you'll be seen as reckless.

Most orgs exist somewhere on the spectrum. Calibrate your approach accordingly.

#### Share Your POV

By day 60, you've earned the right to have opinions. Your fresh eyes are valuable—you see things the team has stopped seeing. But how you share your perspective matters.

**Back it with evidence:**

Don't rely on intuition alone. Use data, customer evidence, competitive context. "I've noticed in the last 5 customer calls, 3 mentioned [pain point]" is stronger than "I think we should focus on [feature]."

**Frame as hypothesis, not proclamation:**

Instead of "We should do X," try "**I'm thinking we should do X because [reasoning]. What am I missing?**" This invites collaboration instead of defensiveness. You're opening a conversation, not closing one.

**Invite challenge:**

End proposals with "**What would change your mind?**" or "**What am I not seeing?**" This signals intellectual humility and makes it safe for others to disagree. The goal is to get to the right answer, not to be right.

**Key Activities**:
- [ ] Lead a project or initiative (not just support)
- [ ] Propose ideas and improvements based on your learnings
- [ ] Mentor or help others (share what you've learned)
- [ ] Establish yourself as the "go-to" for your area
- [ ] Build cross-functional relationships beyond your immediate team
- [ ] Finalize all context files
- [ ] Begin thinking beyond onboarding—what's your 6-month vision?

**Questions to Answer**:
- What do I want to be known for?
- What's my unique contribution to this team?
- Where do I see opportunities others might miss?
- What relationships do I need to invest in long-term?

**Outputs**:
- Led initiative with documented outcomes
- Complete, accurate context files
- Established reputation and relationships
- Clear vision for post-onboarding focus

**Phase Complete When**:
- You've successfully led at least one initiative
- People seek you out for your expertise
- Context files are complete and accurate
- You feel confident operating independently

## Landmines to Avoid

You've read the positive guidance—here's what doesn't work. These are common mistakes that can derail your onboarding. Learn from others' missteps so you don't have to learn from your own.

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | What to Do Instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Dumping user feedback list on team in week 1 | You don't understand context yet; feedback without synthesis adds noise, not insight | Synthesize patterns after 30 days of listening (see Phase 1 → Fresh Eyes Window) |
| Assigning action items in early 1:1s | You haven't earned trust yet; comes across as presumptuous and undermines relationship-building | Ask questions, offer help with "The 9 Magic Words," listen first (see Universal Principles → Relationships Are the Job) |
| Making proclamations before understanding context | Erodes credibility fast; reveals you don't understand the "why" behind decisions | Ask "Why did you do it that way?" before suggesting changes (see Universal Principles → Be a Sponge, Not a Know-It-All) |
| Trying to fix everything you see | Overwhelms you and the team; dilutes focus and drains trust battery on low-impact work | Choose 1-2 high-impact quick wins in Phase 2 (see Phase 2 → Quick Win Finder) |
| Projecting previous company playbook | Every company is different; what worked there may not work here due to different context and constraints | Observe, adapt, then apply lessons learned elsewhere (see Phase 1 → Breadth Over Depth) |
| Ignoring informal power structure | Formal org chart ≠ real influence; missing key stakeholders means your initiatives will stall | Map informal power via "Who do people go to for X?" questions (see Phase 1 → Map the organization) |

### Phase-Specific Anti-Patterns

#### Phase 1 Anti-Patterns (Days 1-30)

**Documentation hole**: Spending weeks reading documentation without talking to people. Context lives in conversations, not wikis. Documentation is a starting point, not the full picture. You'll miss the "why" behind decisions and the informal dynamics that make things work.

→ *See Phase 1 → Two Traps to Avoid: Balance reading with relationship-building from day one.*

**Coming in hot**: Proposing solutions in weeks 1-2 before you understand the problem space. You don't have the context yet. What seems "obvious" to you often has history, constraints, or trade-offs you can't see.

→ *See Phase 1 → Two Traps to Avoid and Universal Principles → Be a Sponge, Not a Know-It-All.*

**Rabbit hole diving**: Deep-diving one area at the expense of breadth. Your fresh eyes window is short—once you've been there 60 days, you'll stop seeing what others have normalized. Use this window to survey broadly, not specialize prematurely.

→ *See Phase 1 → Breadth Over Depth: Survey broadly before specializing.*

#### Phase 2 Anti-Patterns (Days 31-60)

**Big swings too early**: Trying to lead a major initiative before proving competence on smaller wins. You haven't charged your trust battery enough yet. Start with quick wins that demonstrate you can deliver before taking on high-stakes projects.

→ *See Phase 2 → Quick Win Finder and Trust Battery: Build credibility through small, visible wins first.*

**Ghost mode**: Contributing quietly without making your work visible. If nobody sees what you're delivering, your trust battery isn't charging. Share progress early, share drafts, make your contributions known.

→ *See Phase 2 → Trust Battery: Make progress visible.*

**Imposter paralysis**: Waiting until you feel "ready" to contribute because you don't feel like an expert yet. You'll never feel fully ready. Your job in Phase 2 isn't to be the expert—it's to be curious, reliable, and helpful while delivering on small commitments.

→ *See Phase 2 → Navigating Imposter Syndrome: Focus on contribution, not perfection.*

#### Phase 3 Anti-Patterns (Days 61-90)

**Sacred cow slaughter**: Attacking established practices or decisions without understanding their history. Most "obvious problems" exist for reasons you don't see yet. The person who built what you want to change had context you don't have.

→ *See Phase 3 → Navigate Sacred Cows: Talk to the people who built it and ask "Why?" before proposing changes.*

**Lone wolf leadership**: Leading initiatives without building coalitions or getting buy-in from key stakeholders. Product management is influence work—you need allies to get things done. Leading without coalition-building means your initiative will stall.

→ *See Phase 3 → Navigate Sacred Cows and Peacetime vs Wartime Context: Build consensus in peacetime, move decisively in wartime, but never go it alone.*

**Opinion without evidence**: Sharing your point of view based on intuition alone, without backing it with data, customer evidence, or competitive context. By day 60 you've earned the right to have opinions—but you need to back them up.

→ *See Phase 3 → Share Your POV: Back opinions with evidence, frame as hypothesis not proclamation.*

### New Files in This Enhancement

The enhanced onboarding tool includes new working files to support tactical best practices:

**Plan Files:**
- `situational-playback.md` — Prep for situational conversation (playback what you learned to validate understanding). Used at end of Phase 1.

**Working Files:**
- `learning-backlog.md` — 4-category matrix (PM Craft, Product, Market, Business) for tracking what you need to learn
- `relationship-backlog.md` — Stakeholder relationship tracker with cadence, strategy, and next touch planning
- `burning-problems.md` — Tracker for 2-3 burning problems identified by manager/eng lead/design for diagnosis
- `quick-wins.md` — Opportunity tracker with criteria check (Fast, Visible, Low-risk, Unowned)

**Output Directories:**
- `leverage-docs/` — Documentation you create during onboarding (data dictionaries, process maps, guides) that provides leverage for the team

See "Working File Templates" section for templates to populate these files.

## Activation Workflow

When user activates this tool:

1. **Confirm scope**: "Would you like comprehensive (full 90-day) or streamlined (focused 30-day) onboarding?"

2. **Gather context**:
   - What's the company/role?
   - What's your start date?
   - What do you already know about the business?
   - Any specific goals or concerns?

3. **Create project**: Set up the project structure in `projects/active/onboarding/`

4. **Initialize plans** using the templates in `templates/`:
   - Copy `templates/30-60-90-plan.md` → `plan/30-60-90.md`, fill in role/company/start date/scope
   - Copy `templates/weekly-plan.md` → `plan/weekly/week-01.md`, fill in week 1 dates
   - Copy `templates/stakeholder-map.md` → `working/stakeholders.md` as the org/people map
   - Copy `templates/1-1-note.md` to `inputs/1-1s/` as a blank starter for each 1:1 (rename to `[person]-[date].md` at use time)

4.5. **Create enhanced working files**:

   Create in `working/`:
   
   - `learning-backlog.md` — Use 4-category matrix template (PM Craft, Product, Market, Business)
   - `relationship-backlog.md` — Include week 1-2 hit list:
     - Week 1-2 (Essential): Manager, key peers, HR/People partner
     - Week 2-4 (Important): Skip-level, cross-functional partners (Eng, Design, Data)
     - Week 4-8 (Valuable): Customers (if possible), other PMs, tenured employees
   - `burning-problems.md` — Include prompt: "Ask your manager, eng lead, and design lead: 'Is there a burning problem I can investigate and diagnose (not solve)? 2-3 would be ideal.'"
   - `quick-wins.md` — Empty tracker, to populate in Phase 2
   
   Create in `plan/`:
   
   - `situational-playback.md` — Template for end-of-Phase-1 situational conversation
   
   Create in `outputs/`:
   
   - `leverage-docs/` — Directory for documentation created during onboarding

5. **Populate starter questions**: Add common onboarding questions to `working/questions.md`

6. **Guide first actions**: 
   - Schedule **walking 1:1s** (not sitting ones) with manager, key peers, HR in week 1-2
   - Use **"What can I do to make your life easier?"** in every 1:1
   - Ask manager, eng lead, design lead: **"Is there a burning problem I can investigate and diagnose?"** (aim for 2-3)
   - Start **documenting what you learn as you learn it** (data dictionaries, process maps) — save in `outputs/leverage-docs/`
   - Focus on **breadth over depth** — resist rabbit holes, use fresh eyes window
   - Share curated reading resources: see `resources/reading-list.md` in this tool's directory — recommend 2-3 links based on the user's situation (new domain, familiar domain, or leadership role)

## Graduation Workflow

When graduation criteria are met:

1. **Review and finalize outputs**
   - Ensure all context files are complete and accurate
   - Review wins.md for completeness
   - Check for any loose ends in questions.md

2. **Promote context files**
   - Move finalized context from `outputs/context/` to main `context/` folder
   - Update "Last Updated" dates and attribution

3. **Capture learnings**
   - Log key insights to `memory/items/learnings.md`
   - Log any important decisions to `memory/items/decisions.md`

4. **Archive the project**
   - Use `finalize-project` skill
   - Project moves to `projects/archive/onboarding/`

5. **Transition to steady-state**
   - You're now operating in normal PM mode
   - Context is populated, relationships are built
   - The onboarding tool's job is done

## Working File Templates

These are optional working files you can create in the `working/` directory to support your onboarding process. They align with the tactical guidance in each phase and help you track key activities systematically.

### Learning Backlog

Track what you need to learn and how you'll learn it. Create as `working/learning-backlog.md`:

```markdown
## PM Craft
- What do I need to learn?
- Why?
- Who can teach me?
- How will I get it?

## The Product
- What do I need to learn?
- Why?
- Who can teach me?
- How will I get it?

## The Market
- What do I need to learn?
- Why?
- Who can teach me?
- How will I get it?

## The Business
- What do I need to learn?
- Why?
- Who can teach me?
- How will I get it?
```

Use this to prioritize learning and identify mentors early. Update weekly as new gaps emerge.

### Relationship Backlog

Track relationship-building cadence and strategy. Create as `working/relationship-backlog.md`:

```markdown
| Name | Role | Importance | Relationship Strategy | Cadence | Next Touch |
|------|------|------------|----------------------|---------|------------|
| [Person] | [Title] | Essential/Important/Valuable | [How to build rapport] | Weekly/Bi-weekly/Monthly | [Date] |
```

This helps you maintain the **Relationship Maintenance Cadence** from 1:1 Guidance. Use it to track when you last connected and when you should reach out again. Include notes on how to build rapport with each person (their communication style, what they care about, what you can help them with).

### Burning Problems Tracker

Track problems you're investigating in Phase 1. Create as `working/burning-problems.md`:

```markdown
| Problem | Flagged By | Investigation Notes | Diagnosis | Recommendation Timing |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| [Problem description] | [Name] | [What you learned] | [Root cause] | [When to share] |
```

Use this when stakeholders flag **burning problems** (see Phase 1). Track your investigation notes, root cause analysis, and when/how you'll share recommendations. Remember: diagnose, don't solve (yet).

### Quick Win Tracker

Identify and track quick win opportunities in Phase 2. Create as `working/quick-wins.md`:

```markdown
| Opportunity | Effort (days) | Visibility | Risk | Owner Status | Criteria Met? |
|------------|--------------|-----------|------|--------------|---------------|
| [Description] | [2-3 weeks?] | High/Med/Low | Low? | Unowned? | Fast/Visible/Low-risk/Unowned |
```

This helps you apply the **Quick Win Finder** criteria from Phase 2: Fast (2-3 weeks), Visible (impact is seen), Low-risk (won't break things), Unowned (nobody else is working on it). Track opportunities and evaluate them systematically.

### Situational Playback

Prepare for your situational conversation with your manager (Phase 1 graduation). Create as `plan/situational-playback.md`:

```markdown
## What I Learned

### Business & Strategy
- [Key points about business model, strategy, goals]

### Product & Users
- [Key points about product, customers, use cases]

### Team & Dynamics
- [Key points about team structure, culture, decision-making]

## Gaps in Understanding
- [What I still don't know or need to validate]

## Questions for Validation
- [Questions to confirm my understanding is correct]
```

Use this to organize your thoughts before your **situational conversation** (see Phase 1 graduation criteria). Play back what you've learned, surface gaps, and validate your understanding. This proves you've absorbed the context and can articulate it clearly.

## 1:1 Guidance

### The 9 Magic Words

In every 1:1, ask: **"What can I do to make your life easier?"**

This question opens doors and builds relationships faster than any other. It signals you're there to help, not just to extract information or make requests. Use it in every conversation, especially in Phase 1.

### Who to Meet With

**Week 1-2 (Essential)**:
- Direct manager
- Key peer(s) on your team
- HR/People partner

**Week 2-4 (Important)**:
- Skip-level manager
- Cross-functional partners (Eng, Design, etc.)
- Key stakeholders for your area

**Week 4-8 (Valuable)**:
- Customers (if possible)
- Other PMs in the org
- People who've been there longest

### 1:1 Questions by Phase

**Phase 1 - Learn (Days 1-30)**:

Use these questions to build understanding through **situational conversation** (see Phase 1):

- **The 9 Magic Words**: "What can I do to make your life easier?"
- What should I know that's not written down?
- What do you wish you knew when you started?
- What are the biggest challenges right now?
- **Burning problems**: "Is there a problem you're wrestling with that I could investigate and help diagnose?" (Not solve—investigate)
- What's working well that I should understand?
- Why did you approach [decision/system/process] that way? (Know-Why-Before-How)

**Phase 2 - Contribute (Days 31-60)**:

Focus on **quick wins** and **trust battery** building:

- How am I doing so far? Any feedback?
- Where do you see opportunities I could help with?
- What's blocking you that I might be able to address?
- What's one thing I could take off your plate?
- Are there any quick wins you've been meaning to tackle but haven't had time for? (Fast, Visible, Low-risk, Unowned)
- What commitments have I made that I should follow up on?

**Phase 3 - Lead (Days 61-90)**:

Position for **ownership** and **long-term impact**:

- What should I focus on long-term? What does success look like in this role?
- How can we work together most effectively?
- What would make you see me as successful in this role?
- Where do you see opportunities I could own or lead?
- What's your vision for this area in the next 6-12 months?
- **POV sharing**: "I'm thinking we should do X because [reasoning]. What am I missing?"
- What mode are we in—peacetime or wartime? What does that mean for how I should operate?

### Relationship Maintenance Cadence

Track your 1:1 frequency to ensure relationships stay warm and you maintain visibility:

- **Essential contacts** (manager, key peers, critical stakeholders): Weekly or bi-weekly 1:1s
- **Important contacts** (cross-functional partners, skip-level, other PMs): Bi-weekly or monthly check-ins
- **Valuable contacts** (customers, tenured employees, network): Monthly or quarterly conversations

Use the Relationship Backlog template (see Working File Templates below) to track cadence, next touch dates, and relationship strategy for each person.

### Key Principles

1. **Listen more than you talk** (especially in Phase 1)
2. **Build relationships before you need them**
3. **Small wins create momentum** (don't wait for the big project)
4. **Ask "dumb" questions early** (it gets harder later)
5. **Document as you learn** (your future self will thank you)
6. **Understand before you optimize** (resist the urge to fix things immediately)
