| **How to Spend Your First 90 Days** | Product Lessons (Linda Zhang) | Trust battery metaphor, breadth over depth, leverage through documentation, starter project criteria, sacred cows, "because vs despite" | https://productlessons.substack.com/p/how-to-spend-your-first-90-days |
| **Onboarding as a PM** | Shreyas Doshi (YouTube) | "Diagnose, don't solve" framing, don't assign action items in early 1:1s, anti-pattern of dumping user feedback on the team | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55WkR8CjRZk |

## Supplementary

Worth a look, but the primary sources above cover the core material more deeply.

| Source | Key Contribution | Link |
|--------|-----------------|------|
| **30-60-90 Plan for PMs** | Medium / Todd Lewandowski — references a Google Doc template; paywalled but the framing is useful | https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/30-60-90-plan-for-starting-a-new-job-as-a-product-manager-23b60b3ced61 |
| **r/ProductManagement thread** | Community perspectives on first 90 days — raw, practical, peer-sourced | https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/schq02/what_helped_you_most_in_your_first_90_days_as_a/ |
| **Exponent / airfocus / Product Compass** | Checklists, SWOT analysis, SMART goal framing, playbook creation — good for structure but lighter on insight | https://cooked-parmesan-52b.notion.site/956a98503a34403eb373ce11683f74b3?v=26f7afa10147404eb686ae28d7aa35f8&p=ac201e65a8ff4c9e94aa48dd27481c82&pm=s |

## Books

| Book | Why It's Worth Reading |
|------|----------------------|
| **The First 90 Days** — Michael Watkins | The canonical reference. Dense but comprehensive — the "situational conversation" concept in Phase 1 comes directly from Watkins. |
| **Onboarding Isn't Enough** — Mark Stein & Lilith Christiansen | Organizational lens on why onboarding fails and how to make it stick. More relevant for leaders than ICs. |

## How to Use This List

**At tool activation**: Share the top 3 links most relevant to the user's situation:
- New company + new domain → Ant Murphy + Deb Liu + Ken Norton
- Familiar domain, focused on quick wins → Lenny's Newsletter + Product Lessons (Linda Zhang)
- Leadership role → Deb Liu + "The First 90 Days" (Watkins)

**During Phase 1**: The Shreyas Doshi video (~20 min) is worth watching in week 1 — the "diagnose, don't solve" framing changes how you approach your first 1:1s.

**During Phase 2**: Linda Zhang's trust battery and quick win criteria are directly applicable when you're looking for your first win.
