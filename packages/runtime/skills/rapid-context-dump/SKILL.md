# Rapid Context Dump Skill

A reusable capability that converts user-provided inputs (pasted text, folder contents, website URL) into reviewable draft context artifacts. Supports standalone use or invocation from the onboarding flow.

## When to Use

- User has existing docs/content they want to import
- User wants to bootstrap context from their company website
- Called from onboarding skill Path A
- User says "dump my context" or "import my docs"

## When NOT to Use

- User wants to import meeting history (use `seed-context` tool)
- User wants guided Q&A to build context (use `onboarding` skill Path B)
- Context files already exist and are populated

---

## Workflow Overview

```
Consent → Input Collection → Extraction → Draft Generation → Review → Promotion
```

**Total time**: 5-15 minutes depending on input volume

---

## Phase 1: Consent Checkpoint

Before ingesting any content, show consent and guidance:

```
Before we begin, a few important notes:

⚠️ **What will be processed:**
- Text you paste or files you provide will be read and analyzed
- Content is processed locally in your workspace
- Generated drafts are saved to your workspace for review

⚠️ **What to exclude:**
- Confidential/sensitive documents (financials, legal, HR)
- Content you don't have rights to share
- Large binary files (images, videos) — not supported

✓ Ready to proceed?
```

Wait for user confirmation before continuing.

---

## Phase 2: Input Collection

Collect context from one or more input types. Use fallback matrix when inputs are unavailable.

### Input Types (Priority Order)

| Priority | Input | How to Collect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Pasted text** | Ask user to paste content directly into chat |
| 2 | **Folder** | Read files from `inputs/onboarding-dump/` |
| 3 | **Website URL** | Fetch and parse company website |
| 4 | **Chat upload** | If supported by environment (optional) |

### Input Prompts

**For pasted text:**
```
Paste your content below. This could be:
- Strategy docs or OKRs
- Product descriptions
- User research notes
- Competitive analysis
- Anything that describes your business/product

I'll extract the key information and create draft context files.
```

**For folder:**
```
I'll check inputs/onboarding-dump/ for files to process.

Supported formats: .md, .txt, .pdf (text only), .docx (text only)

Drop your files there and let me know when ready.
```

**For website:**
```
What's your company website URL?

I'll extract:
- Company description and value proposition
- Product/service information
- Target audience signals
- Any public strategy/positioning
```

### Fallback Matrix

| Situation | Fallback |
|---|---|
| User has no structured content | Prompt for website URL |
| Folder empty or files unsupported | Continue with pasted text + URL |
| Website inaccessible or low signal | Continue with folder/pasted text |
| Chat upload unsupported | Route to folder or paste path |

**Key principle**: Never block. If one input fails, gracefully continue with others.

---

## Phase 3: Extraction

Process collected inputs and extract structured information.

### Extraction Targets

From inputs, attempt to extract:

1. **Business Overview**
   - Company name and description
   - Mission/vision
   - Value proposition
   - Industry/market

2. **Products/Services**
   - Product names and descriptions
   - Key features
   - Pricing model (if public)

3. **Users/Personas**
   - Target user types
   - User problems/needs
   - User segments

4. **Goals/Strategy**
   - Stated objectives
   - Key metrics mentioned
   - Strategic priorities

5. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Competitors mentioned
   - Differentiation points
   - Market positioning

6. **Domain Hints** (for Contract v1)
   - Company domains extracted from URLs
   - Industry signals
   - Technology stack mentions

### Extraction Guidelines

- **Be conservative**: Only extract what's clearly stated
- **Cite sources**: Note which input each piece came from
- **Flag uncertainty**: Mark inferred vs stated information
- **Preserve quotes**: Keep key phrases verbatim when valuable

---

## Phase 4: Draft Generation

Generate draft context files with explicit draft markers.

### Draft File Format

Each generated file must include:

```markdown
<!-- 
[DRAFT] Generated by rapid-context-dump
Source: [input type - pasted/folder/website]
Generated: [ISO timestamp]
Status: PENDING REVIEW - Do not use until promoted
-->

# [Title]

[Content...]

---

## Source References

- [Source 1]: "[relevant excerpt]"
- [Source 2]: "[relevant excerpt]"
```

### Files to Generate

| File | Location | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Business Overview | `context/business-overview.md` | Yes |
| Users/Personas | `context/users-personas.md` | If extractable |
| Products/Services | `context/products-services.md` | If extractable |
| Strategy Summary | `goals/strategy.md` | If extractable |
| Competitive Landscape | `context/competitive-landscape.md` | If extractable |

### Draft Strategy Summary

Also generate a one-page summary:

```markdown
<!-- [DRAFT] Strategy Summary -->

# Strategy Summary

## Company
[1-2 sentences]

## Product
[1-2 sentences]

## Users
[1-2 sentences]

## Goals
[Bullet list]

## Key Insights
[2-3 observations from the content]

## Gaps Identified
[What's missing that should be added manually]
```

Save to: `inputs/onboarding-dump/draft-strategy-summary.md`

---

## Phase 5: Review Checklist

Present generated drafts with review checklist:

```
I've generated the following draft files:

**Context Files:**
- [ ] context/business-overview.md — Review accuracy
- [ ] context/users-personas.md — Review completeness
- [ ] context/products-services.md — Review accuracy
- [ ] goals/strategy.md — Review priorities

**Summary:**
- [ ] inputs/onboarding-dump/draft-strategy-summary.md

**Review Checklist:**
1. Open each file and verify accuracy
2. Remove or correct any misinterpretations
3. Add missing information you know
4. Remove the [DRAFT] header when satisfied

**To promote a file:** Edit it, remove the draft header, save.

Would you like me to walk through any file with you?
```

---

## Phase 6: Promotion

Drafts become canonical only after user review:

**Promotion criteria:**
- User has opened/reviewed the file
- User confirms content is accurate
- [DRAFT] header is removed

**Promotion options:**

1. **Manual promotion**: User edits file, removes header, saves
2. **Guided promotion**: User says "promote business-overview" and agent removes header

```
To promote: "promote [filename]" or edit the file and remove the [DRAFT] header.

Files remain drafts until you explicitly promote them.
```

## Contract v1 Compliance

This skill emits domain hints for downstream People Intelligence:

| Contract Field | Emitted? | Location |
|---|---|---|
| `context.companyDomains[]` | Yes | Extracted from website URL |
| `context.sourceHints[]` | Yes | Embedded in draft source references |
| `context.artifactRefs[]` | Yes | List of generated draft files |

**Domain hint extraction:**
- From website URL: extract domain (e.g., `acme.com`)
- From email addresses in content: extract domains
- From mentioned URLs: extract relevant domains

Store hints in `context/domain-hints.md`:
```markdown
---
domains:
  - acme.com
  - acme.io
extracted_from:
  - website
  - pasted_content
generated: [ISO timestamp]
---

# Domain Hints

Automatically extracted domain signals for downstream use.
```

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|---|---|
| Website unreachable | "Couldn't reach [URL]. Let's continue with other inputs." |
| Folder empty | "No supported files found. Try pasting content directly." |
| Extraction yielded nothing | "Couldn't extract structured info. Let me ask you directly instead." (Fall back to guided input) |
| File write failed | "Couldn't save to [path]. Check workspace permissions." |

## Tips

1. **Quality over quantity**: Better to extract less accurately than more incorrectly
2. **Preserve user's words**: Don't over-paraphrase; their terminology matters
3. **Flag gaps explicitly**: "I couldn't find X" is valuable information
4. **Stay focused**: Extract what helps PM work, not everything possible
