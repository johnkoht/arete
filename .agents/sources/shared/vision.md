# Areté Vision

**Areté** (ἀρετή) - Ancient Greek concept meaning "excellence" - the pursuit of fulfilling one's purpose to the highest degree.

Areté is a Product Management workspace that helps PMs streamline their workflows through structured context, project-based work, and institutional memory. The driving question behind every feature and design decision: **Does it help the product builder achieve arete?**

Product builders need clarity, understanding, vision, and strategy. They must navigate stakeholders, negotiate, inspire, and align. They synthesize signal from noise, make decisions under uncertainty, and benefit from structure that preserves institutional memory and sharpens judgment.

Areté exists so product builders have a workspace that elevates their practice: context that stays current, memory that persists, and workflows that reduce friction and sharpen thinking.
