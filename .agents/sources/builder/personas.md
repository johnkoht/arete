|purpose:Voice-of-customer check during feature planning; prevents BUILD enthusiasm from producing GUIDE complexity
|definitions:dev/personas/PERSONA_COUNCIL.md
|instructions:dev/personas/COUNCIL_INSTRUCTIONS.md
|invoke:when feature involves user workflow steps, input prompts, configuration, or any step GUIDE MODE user must take
|skip:internal architecture, build tooling, bug fixes with no UX change
|output:concrete policy — required/optional/skip/cut — not vague persona reactions
|evidence:personas are hypothesis-based until Evidence sections are populated with real signal
