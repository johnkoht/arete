# User-specific (Arete build)

This file is for **you** as the developer of Arete. Copy to `USER.md` (gitignored) and customize.

- **Local env**: Node version, Python path, any local overrides
- **Preferences**: How you like to run tests, preferred editors, branch naming
- **Context**: Things that would confuse an agent (e.g. "I always use pnpm locally")
- **Reminders**: Personal TODOs, follow-ups that aren't in Linear

## Example

```markdown
- Node: nvm use (20.x)
- I use pnpm; package.json scripts work but I run `pnpm test` not `npm test`
- Fathom: test with sandbox API key in .credentials (see SETUP.md)
```
