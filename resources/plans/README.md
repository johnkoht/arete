# Planning

Quarter and weekly plans live here. They align to org strategy in `context/goals-strategy.md`.

## Hierarchy

- **Quarter goals**: `quarter-YYYY-Qn.md` (e.g. `quarter-2026-Q1.md`) — 3–5 outcomes per quarter with links to org pillars/OKRs.
- **Week priorities**: `week-YYYY-Www.md` (e.g. `week-2026-W06.md`) — top 3–5 outcomes per week, linked to quarter goals.
- **Daily** (Phase 2): Lightweight in scratchpad or a section in the week file; full daily plans later.

## Archive

Past quarter and week files can go in `resources/plans/archive/` to keep the root focused on current plans.

## Skills

Use **quarter-plan**, **goals-alignment**, **week-plan**, and **week-review** skills to create and update these files.
