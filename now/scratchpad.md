## Backlog

**For mature ideas with details**, see `.cursor/build/backlog/README.md`

Items below should be moved to backlog/ when they're fleshed out enough to become PRDs.

### High Priority (Ready for PRD)
- ✅ **Google Calendar provider** — Moved to `.cursor/build/backlog/features/google-calendar-provider.md`
- ✅ **Automated code review checks** — Moved to `.cursor/build/backlog/improvements/automated-code-review.md`
- ✅ **Progress dashboard** — Moved to `.cursor/build/backlog/features/progress-dashboard.md`

### Quick Ideas (Need More Detail)
- Microsoft Calendar provider (similar to Google Calendar)
- Notion integration (read-only sync of pages)
- Linear/Jira integration (pull issue data for project context)
- Slack integration (pull messages, push updates)
- Search performance benchmarking (large workspaces)
- Search result caching (repeated queries)
- QMD status awareness (health checks, suggest updates)

### This Week Tasks
- **Update AGENTS.md** — Add section "11. Autonomous PRD Execution" documenting the orchestration pattern. See `.cursor/build/entries/2026-02-09_builder-orchestration-learnings.md` for content.
- **Validate execute-prd** — Test on next real PRD (when one comes up). Don't create artificial PRDs just for testing.
