description: Context management - how to read, update, and archive context files
globs: ["context/**/*"]

# Context Management

The `context/` folder contains the source of truth for business and product information. These files change infrequently and only through explicit finalization.

## Context Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `business-overview.md` | Company basics, mission, stage, strategic focus |
| `business-model.md` | Revenue streams, pricing, unit economics |
| `competitive-landscape.md` | Competitors, market position, differentiation |
| `products-services.md` | Current product portfolio and offerings |
| `goals-strategy.md` | Business goals, OKRs, strategic direction |
| `users-personas.md` | Target users, pain points, needs |

## Reading Context

Before starting any significant work:

1. Identify which context files are relevant
2. Read them to understand the current state
3. Note any gaps or outdated information
4. Use QMD to search for additional context: `qmd query "[topic]"`

## When Context Changes

Context should ONLY be updated during project finalization:

1. **Never edit context directly** during active work
2. Work within your project's `working/` folder
3. When finalizing, identify what should update context
4. Follow the archiving process below

## Archiving Process

Before updating any context file:

1. **Copy current version** to `context/_history/YYYY-MM-DD_filename.md`
2. **Add archive note** at top of archived file:
   ```markdown
   > **Archived**: YYYY-MM-DD
   > **Reason**: [Why this version was archived]
   > **Replaced by**: Current version in context/
   ```
3. **Update the context file** with new information
4. **Update "Last Updated"** date in the file

## Archive Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD_original-filename.md`

Examples:
- `2026-01-27_business-overview.md`
- `2026-01-27_competitive-landscape.md`

## Context File Structure

Each context file should include:

```markdown
# [Title]

> **Purpose**: [What this file documents]
> **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
> **Updated By**: [Project that triggered update]

[Content organized by sections...]

---
## Change History
- YYYY-MM-DD: [What changed and why]
- YYYY-MM-DD: [Previous change]
```

## Handling Outdated Context

If you notice context is outdated while working:

1. **Note it in scratchpad.md** for later
2. **Continue with current work** using available context
3. **Address during finalization** if relevant to current project
4. **Or create a dedicated project** if significant update needed

## Context Gaps

If a context file is empty or missing key info:

1. **Proceed with available information**
2. **Note the gap** in your project's README
3. **Suggest populating** during project wrap-up
4. **Don't block work** waiting for perfect context

## Cross-References

When context files reference each other:
- Use relative links: `See [Users & Personas](users-personas.md)`
- Keep references updated during changes
- Note dependencies in change history
