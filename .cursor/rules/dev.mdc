# Dev practices (Arete build)

Standards for building and changing Arete. For conventions, memory usage, skills index, and CLI reference, see **AGENTS.md** (the compressed, always-loaded context).

**Testing** is covered in `testing.mdc`; **Plan Mode pre-mortem** is in `plan-pre-mortem.mdc`.

---

## Quality Gates (mandatory for ALL commits)

Before any commit, these **must pass**:

```bash
npm run typecheck  # Must pass
npm test           # Must pass (full suite, not just new tests)
```

If the work touches Python (`scripts/integrations/`), also run:
```bash
npm run test:py
```

**No exceptions** — even for "quick fixes." Quality gates catch ripple effects.

---

## Execution Path Decision Tree

When you approve a plan (in Plan Mode or otherwise), follow this decision tree:

```
User approves plan
     |
     ├─ Tiny (1-2 simple steps: fix typo, add comment, update string)
     |  → Direct execution
     |  → Quality gates (typecheck + test) ✓
     |  → Skip pre-mortem, skip memory capture
     |
     ├─ Small (2-3 moderate steps: add function + tests, refactor module)
     |  → Ask: "Run pre-mortem first? (Recommended for new features)"
     |  → Direct execution (with optional pre-mortem)
     |  → Quality gates ✓
     |  → Offer: "Capture learnings?" at end
     |
     └─ Medium/Large (3+ steps OR complex: new system, integration, refactor)
        → Strongly recommend: "PRD path or direct execution?"
        → If PRD: Load .agents/skills/plan-to-prd/SKILL.md (full execute-prd workflow)
        → If direct: Apply pre-mortem + quality gates + memory capture
```

**Examples:**

| User Request | Size | Path | Why |
|-------------|------|------|-----|
| "Fix typo in README" | Tiny | Direct, no pre-mortem | Single file, trivial change |
| "Add validation to email field" | Small | Ask about pre-mortem | 2-3 files, clear scope |
| "Add retry logic with exponential backoff" | Small→Medium | Pre-mortem recommended | 2-3 files but touches error handling |
| "Add calendar integration" | Large | Recommend PRD | New system, 5+ tasks, integration risk |

**When in doubt**: Offer both paths and let builder choose.

## Code Review Checklist (for any substantial change)

Apply this 6-point checklist before committing:

- [ ] **Uses `.js` extensions** in imports (NodeNext module resolution)
- [ ] **No `any` types** (strict TypeScript)
- [ ] **Proper error handling** (try/catch with graceful fallback)
- [ ] **Tests for happy path and edge cases**
- [ ] **Backward compatibility preserved** (function signatures unchanged unless explicitly breaking)
- [ ] **Follows project patterns** (see existing code, AGENTS.md conventions)

If any item fails, fix before committing.

## LEARNINGS.md Convention

<!-- SYNC: The 4 behavioral rules below are mirrored in .pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md §LEARNINGS.md. Update both together. -->

Component-local knowledge files that capture incident-anchored gotchas, invariants, and patterns. Soft cap: ~100 lines per file.

### Template (7 sections; each 3-10 lines initially)

```markdown
## How This Works
<!-- 5-10 lines: key files, entry points, dependencies, how pieces connect, where tests live -->

## Key References
<!-- Pointers to related source files, tests, docs, AGENTS.md sections -->

## Gotchas
<!-- Specific things that break and why — must reference file paths or past incidents -->

## Invariants
<!-- Things that must remain true — contracts, constraints, assumptions -->

## Testing Gaps
<!-- What's not covered, what to watch — stub initially, fill after incidents -->

## Patterns That Work
<!-- Proven approaches for this component — stub initially, fill when patterns emerge -->

## Pre-Edit Checklist
<!-- Specific verification steps before and after changes -->
```

### Behavioral Rules

1. Before editing files in a directory, check for LEARNINGS.md in the same directory as the file being edited, then each parent directory up to (but not including) the repository root. Stop at the first LEARNINGS.md found; read it. If editing files in multiple directories, check each.
2. After fixing any bug or regression, add entry to nearest LEARNINGS.md describing what broke, why, and how to avoid it. If no LEARNINGS.md exists nearby and the gotcha is non-obvious, create one.
3. Regression tests should include a comment explaining the failure mode they prevent.
4. When an agent discovers something missing from or inaccurate in a LEARNINGS.md, update it immediately.

### What LEARNINGS.md is NOT for

- Not for architecture decisions or rationale (that's `memory/entries/`)
- Not for TODO items or future work (that's `scratchpad.md` or `dev/work/plans/`)
- Not for full API documentation (that's code comments or README)
- Not for general coding standards (that's AGENTS.md / conventions)
- Not for every directory (create organically after regressions, not proactively)

### Seeded Paths (check these first)

- `.pi/extensions/plan-mode/LEARNINGS.md`
- `packages/core/src/search/LEARNINGS.md`
- `packages/core/src/services/LEARNINGS.md`
- `packages/core/src/integrations/LEARNINGS.md`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/LEARNINGS.md`
- `packages/runtime/rules/LEARNINGS.md`

## Skill and Rule Changes (mandatory review)

**When**: Before creating or modifying any skill or rule file.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] **Audience check**: Is this for BUILD (dev/, .cursor/, .agents/) or PRODUCT (runtime/)?
- [ ] **AGENTS.md sources**: If the skill/rule changes workflows, update `.agents/sources/` and rebuild
- [ ] **Cross-references**: Search for references to the skill/rule being changed; update them
- [ ] **APPEND_SYSTEM.md sync**: If changing LEARNINGS.md rules, update `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` to match (and vice versa)

**AGENTS.md is generated** — do not edit it directly. Update source files in `.agents/sources/` and rebuild:

```bash
npm run build:agents:dev  # Rebuild BUILD AGENTS.md
npm run build             # Rebuild GUIDE AGENTS.md (included in package build)
```

See `.agents/sources/README.md` for detailed editing workflow.

---

## Multi-IDE Consistency Check

**When**: Before editing files in `runtime/rules/`, `runtime/tools/`, or `.agents/sources/guide/`.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] **No "either/or" paths**: Don't write `.cursor/X or .claude/X` — use only `.cursor/X` (adapter transforms it)
- [ ] **No hardcoded IDE names in content**: Use `.cursor/` paths; the adapter handles `.claude/` conversion

**Pre-commit check**:
```bash
rg "\.cursor.*or.*\.claude|\.claude.*or.*\.cursor" .agents/sources/ runtime/
```

---

## Documentation Planning Checklist

When creating plans that touch code/features/structure, ask: **"Does this need doc updates?"**

**Scope Check:**
- [ ] All root docs: README, SETUP, AGENTS sources, scratchpad
- [ ] Backlog items: `grep -l "update.*\.md\|docs" dev/work/backlog/*.md`

**Search Strategy:**
- [ ] Feature keywords: `rg "keyword1|keyword2" -g "*.md"`
- [ ] Concept audit: If feature changes paths/structure, grep old paths in all `.md` files

**Anti-pattern:** Do not assume "documentation" = README + SETUP. scratchpad and backlog frequently need updates.

---

## Before Committing

1. `npm run typecheck`
2. `npm run test:all` (or `npm test` + `npm run test:py`)
3. New code → new/updated tests (see `testing.mdc`)
