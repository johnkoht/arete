# Areté Source Repository

This is the Areté development repository. You are building Areté itself, not using it as a PM workspace.

## Guidelines

- **Memory**: Put build memories in `memory/entries/` and add a line to `memory/MEMORY.md`. Do **not** use `memory/items/` for build decisions or learnings.
- **PRDs**: Areté feature PRDs go in `dev/prds/{feature-name}/prd.md`, not in `projects/active/`.
- **Rules**: Follow dev.mdc and testing.mdc. Use AGENTS.md for architecture.
- **Skills**: Product skills (meeting-prep, create-prd, etc.) exist here for development; build skills (execute-prd, prd-to-json, plan-to-prd) under `dev/` are available. Do not run `arete seed test-data` in this repo.
- **Workspace setup**: Do **not** run `arete install` or `arete update` in this directory. This is the Areté source tree; those commands are for end-user workspaces only.
- **Projects**: Do not treat `projects/active/` as the PM's projects; that structure is for end users.
