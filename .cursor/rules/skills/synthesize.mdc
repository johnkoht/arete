# Synthesize Skill

Help users process raw inputs from projects into structured insights, patterns, and decisions.

## Trigger Phrases

- "synthesize"
- "process my inputs"
- "what did we learn"
- "summarize findings"
- "pull together"

## When to Use

- After gathering research inputs
- Before making decisions
- When inputs feel overwhelming
- To prepare for finalization

## Workflow

### 1. Inventory Inputs

First, inventory what's available in the project's `inputs/` folder:

```bash
# Use QMD to search project inputs
qmd search "[topic]" -c pm-workspace
```

List inputs by type:
- Meeting notes
- Interview transcripts
- Feedback
- Data/metrics
- Research

### 2. Read & Extract

For each input, extract:

**Key Facts**
- Concrete observations
- Quotes
- Data points

**Interpretations**
- What this suggests
- Patterns observed

**Questions Raised**
- What this makes you wonder
- Gaps identified

### 3. Pattern Recognition

Look across inputs for:

**Recurring Themes**
- What comes up multiple times?
- From different sources?

**Contradictions**
- Where do sources disagree?
- What explains the difference?

**Surprises**
- What was unexpected?
- What challenges assumptions?

**Gaps**
- What's missing?
- What do we still not know?

### 4. Create Synthesis Document

Write to `working/synthesis.md`:

```markdown
# Synthesis: [Topic]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Inputs Reviewed**: [List]
**Synthesized By**: [Agent + User]

## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of key takeaways]

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: [Title]
**Observation**: [What we saw]
**Evidence**: 
- [Source 1]: "[Quote or data]"
- [Source 2]: "[Quote or data]"
**Confidence**: High / Medium / Low
**Implication**: [What this means]

### Finding 2: [Title]
...

## Patterns Observed

### Pattern: [Name]
**Seen in**: [Sources]
**Description**: [What the pattern is]
**Significance**: [Why it matters]

## Contradictions & Tensions

### [Topic]
- **View A**: [Position] (from [source])
- **View B**: [Position] (from [source])
- **Resolution**: [How to reconcile, or note as open question]

## Surprises

- **[Surprise]**: [Why unexpected, what it means]

## Open Questions

- [Question]: [Why it matters, how we might answer]

## Recommendations

Based on this synthesis:

1. **[Action]**: [Because...]
2. **[Action]**: [Because...]

## Next Steps

- [ ] [Follow-up needed]
- [ ] [Decision to make]
```

### 5. Decision Preparation

If synthesis is meant to inform a decision, add:

```markdown
## Decision Framework

### The Decision
[What needs to be decided]

### Options
#### Option A: [Name]
- **Pros**: 
- **Cons**: 
- **Evidence supporting**: 

#### Option B: [Name]
- **Pros**: 
- **Cons**: 
- **Evidence supporting**: 

### Recommendation
[Your recommendation and why]

### Risks of Recommendation
[What could go wrong]

### Reversibility
[How easy to change course]
```

### 6. Review with User

Present synthesis and:
- Confirm interpretation of inputs
- Discuss patterns and surprises
- Validate recommendations
- Identify missing perspectives

### 7. Update Working Documents

Based on review:
- Refine synthesis
- Note disagreements
- Add additional context
- Flag items for memory

## Synthesis Tips

**Stay Grounded in Evidence**
- Cite sources for findings
- Distinguish fact from interpretation
- Note confidence levels

**Embrace Contradictions**
- Don't force false consensus
- Contradictions often reveal important nuances
- Explore why sources differ

**Be Explicit About Gaps**
- What don't we know?
- What would change our conclusions?
- What's the cost of being wrong?

**Actionable Output**
- Findings should lead somewhere
- Recommendations should be specific
- Next steps should be clear

## Integration with QMD

### Before Synthesis

If the user has recently added inputs, prompt them to update the index:

```
Before searching for related content, you may want to update the search index:
  qmd update
This ensures your recent inputs are included in the search.
```

### Search for Related Content

Use QMD to enhance synthesis:

```bash
# Find related past learnings
qmd query "what did we learn about [topic]"

# Find relevant decisions
qmd search "decision [related area]"

# Find similar past synthesis
qmd vsearch "synthesis [problem area]"
```

Reference past work to:
- Build on previous insights
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Connect to institutional knowledge
