# Construct Roadmap Skill

Guide users through building, updating, and communicating product roadmaps.

## Trigger Phrases

- "build roadmap"
- "update roadmap"
- "roadmap planning"
- "quarterly planning"
- "prioritize backlog"

## Workflow

### 1. Project Setup

Create roadmap project:

```
projects/active/[period]-roadmap/
├── README.md
├── inputs/
│   ├── initiatives/
│   ├── feedback/
│   └── constraints/
├── working/
│   ├── prioritization.md
│   └── draft-roadmap.md
└── outputs/
    └── roadmap.md
```

### 2. Gather Inputs

Collect inputs for roadmap planning:

**Strategic Inputs**
- Company goals (from `context/goals-strategy.md`)
- Product vision
- Key metrics to move

**Demand Inputs**
- Customer feedback
- Sales requests
- Support tickets
- User research

**Supply Inputs**
- Team capacity
- Technical constraints
- Dependencies
- Tech debt priorities

**External Inputs**
- Market trends
- Competitive moves
- Regulatory requirements

### 3. Candidate Initiatives

List all potential initiatives in `inputs/initiatives/`:

```markdown
# Initiative: [Name]

**Problem/Opportunity**: [What this addresses]
**Proposed Solution**: [High-level approach]
**Target Outcome**: [What success looks like]
**Requestor/Source**: [Where this came from]

## Sizing Estimates
- **Effort**: S / M / L / XL
- **Impact**: Low / Medium / High
- **Confidence**: Low / Medium / High

## Dependencies
- [What this depends on]

## Risks
- [Key risks]

## Strategic Alignment
- [How it connects to goals]
```

### 4. Prioritization Framework

Default to **RICE** scoring:

| Factor | Description | Scale |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Reach** | How many users affected | Number |
| **Impact** | How much it moves metrics | 0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive) |
| **Confidence** | How sure are we | 0.5 (low) to 1 (high) |
| **Effort** | Person-weeks to build | Number |

**RICE Score** = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Create `working/prioritization.md`:

```markdown
# Prioritization: [Period]

## Framework: RICE

| Initiative | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | Score |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| [Init A] | 1000 | 2 | 0.8 | 4 | 400 |
| [Init B] | 500 | 3 | 0.5 | 2 | 375 |

## Additional Considerations
- Strategic alignment
- Dependencies
- Risk/complexity
- Customer commitments

## Prioritized List
1. [Initiative] - Score: X, Notes: [why]
2. [Initiative] - Score: Y, Notes: [why]
```

**Alternative Frameworks**:
- **MoSCoW**: Must/Should/Could/Won't
- **Value vs. Effort**: 2x2 matrix
- **Kano Model**: Basic/Performance/Delighters
- **Weighted Scoring**: Custom criteria weights

### 5. Capacity Planning

Assess team capacity:

```markdown
## Capacity: [Period]

**Team Size**: X engineers, Y designers
**Available Weeks**: [Total - PTO - overhead]
**Capacity**: ~[X] person-weeks

### Allocation
- New Features: 60%
- Tech Debt: 20%
- Bugs/Maintenance: 20%

### Constraints
- [Key constraint]
- [Key dependency]
```

### 6. Draft Roadmap

Create `working/draft-roadmap.md`:

**Timeline View**:
```markdown
# Roadmap: [Period]

## Q1 2026
### Now (In Progress)
- [Initiative]: [Status, Owner]

### Next (Committed)
- [Initiative]: [Target date]
- [Initiative]: [Target date]

### Later (Planned)
- [Initiative]
- [Initiative]

## Q2 2026
### Planned
- [Initiative]
- [Initiative]

## Future (Exploratory)
- [Initiative]
- [Initiative]
```

**Theme-Based View**:
```markdown
# Roadmap by Theme

## Theme: [User Acquisition]
- Q1: [Initiative]
- Q2: [Initiative]

## Theme: [Retention]
- Q1: [Initiative]
- Q2: [Initiative]

## Theme: [Platform]
- Q1: [Initiative]
- Q2: [Initiative]
```

### 7. Review & Refine

Before finalizing:

1. **Sanity check capacity**: Does it fit?
2. **Check dependencies**: Sequencing correct?
3. **Validate with stakeholders**: Major objections?
4. **Document trade-offs**: What we're NOT doing
5. **Risk assessment**: What could derail this?

### 8. Final Output

Create `outputs/roadmap.md`:

```markdown
# Product Roadmap: [Period]

**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner**: [Name]
**Review Cycle**: [Monthly/Quarterly]

## Strategic Context
[Brief summary of goals this roadmap supports]

## Roadmap Overview

### Now (In Progress)
| Initiative | Owner | Status | Target |
|------------|-------|--------|--------|
| [Name] | [Team] | [Status] | [Date] |

### Next (Committed)
| Initiative | Owner | Target | Notes |
|------------|-------|--------|-------|
| [Name] | [Team] | [Quarter] | |

### Later (Planned)
| Initiative | Target | Confidence |
|------------|--------|------------|
| [Name] | [Quarter] | Medium |

### Future (Exploratory)
- [Initiative]
- [Initiative]

## Key Dependencies
- [Dependency and impact]

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk] | [High/Med/Low] | [Plan] |

## What We're NOT Doing
- [Initiative]: [Why deprioritized]

## Change Log
- YYYY-MM-DD: [Change made]
```

### 9. Context Update

After finalizing:

1. Consider updating `context/goals-strategy.md` if roadmap reflects strategic shifts
2. Log major prioritization decisions to `memory/decisions.md`
3. Set calendar for roadmap review

## Roadmap Best Practices

- **Outcomes over outputs**: Frame around problems, not features
- **Appropriate precision**: Detailed near-term, fuzzy long-term
- **Living document**: Update regularly, note changes
- **Communication tool**: Tailor for audience
- **Not a commitment**: Plans change, that's okay
