## Example Entry

```
## Task task-1: Add utility function to core utils
Completed: 2026-02-06 14:30

### What Changed
- Modified src/core/utils.ts
- Added formatTimestamp function with proper TypeScript types

### Learnings
- This codebase uses strict TypeScript with NodeNext module resolution
- All imports must use .js extensions even for .ts files
- The utils.ts file follows a pattern of pure functions with no side effects

### Notes for Future Tasks
- When adding utilities, check if similar functionality exists first
- Follow the existing naming convention: verbNoun format
- Always export both the function and its types
