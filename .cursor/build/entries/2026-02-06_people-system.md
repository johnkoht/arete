# People System

**Date**: 2026-02-06

## Summary

Added a **People** system to Areté so users can track internal colleagues, customers, and users; view them in an index/table and per-person detail pages; and relate them to meetings and projects via email or stable slug.

## What Was Done

- **Workspace paths**: Extended `WorkspacePaths` in `src/types.ts` with `people`; added to `getWorkspacePaths()` in `src/core/workspace.ts`.
- **Install**: New workspace dirs `people`, `people/internal`, `people/customers`, `people/users` and default `people/index.md` in `src/commands/install.ts`.
- **Types**: `Person` and `PersonCategory` ('internal' | 'customers' | 'users') in `src/types.ts`.
- **Core module**: `src/core/people.ts` — `listPeople()`, `getPersonBySlug()`, `getPersonByEmail()`, `updatePeopleIndex()`, `slugifyPersonName()`. Person files are markdown with YAML frontmatter under `people/{category}/{slug}.md`.
- **CLI**: `arete people list [--category]`, `arete people show <slug-or-email> [--category]`, `arete people index` in `src/commands/people.ts` and registered in `src/cli.ts`.
- **Status**: `arete status` now includes `people/` in workspace directories check.
- **Template**: `templates/inputs/person.md` for new person files (placeholders for name, email, role, company, team, category).
- **Linking conventions**: Documented in AGENTS.md — meetings may use frontmatter `attendee_ids: [slug]`; projects may use `stakeholders: [slug]`. Lookup by email supports "Recent meetings" style features. No change to meeting save flow in this pass; conventions are documented for future use.
- **Tests**: `test/core/people.test.ts` for slugify, listPeople, getPersonBySlug, getPersonByEmail, updatePeopleIndex. `test/core/workspace.test.ts` updated for `paths.people`.
- **Docs**: AGENTS.md updated (People as Key System #5, directory structure, CLI list; Future Concepts no longer lists People). README.md updated (structure and What This Is). Build memory: this entry and MEMORY.md index.

## Design Notes

- Categories are **internal**, **customers**, **users** (per product plan). External subcategories (e.g. prospects, partners) can be added later under `people/external/` or by extending `PersonCategory`.
- Identity: **slug** (from name) + optional **email**. Email is the primary key for matching meeting attendees to person records when implementing auto-linking.
- Index table is regenerated by `arete people index`; it is not updated automatically on every file change.
