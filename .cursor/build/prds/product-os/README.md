# Product OS Architecture Evolution

## Summary

Evolve Areté from a skill-centric PM workspace to a product intelligence operating system. The core shift: organize around five product primitives (Problem, User, Solution, Market, Risk), build an intelligence layer that powers any skill, restructure the workspace for clarity, and ship opinionated defaults that users can swap.
