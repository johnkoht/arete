## HOW TO USE THIS INDEX

When a user asks for help with a PM task:
1. Scan the [Skills] section below for matching triggers
2. Read the skill file at the path shown
3. Follow the skill's workflow

Example: User says "help me prep for my meeting" → find meeting-prep in [Skills] → read .agents/skills/meeting-prep/SKILL.md

[Vision]|Excellence (ἀρετή) for product builders
|question:"Does it help the product builder achieve arete?"
|achieve:gain clarity → navigate ambiguity → automate mundane → move faster → unlock opportunity → think better → challenge constructively

[Workspace]|two contexts: USER (installed) vs BUILD (this repo)
|user:now/ goals/ context/ projects/ resources/ .arete/ people/ templates/ .agents/skills/
|build:packages/ memory/ .agents/ dev/(backlog, plans, archive/prds, autonomous)/ .cursor/ .pi/ scripts/
|key_diff:memory/ at root (BUILD) vs .arete/memory/ (USER); .agents/skills/ = build skills (BUILD) vs product skills (USER)

[CLI]
|arete route "<query>":Route user message to best skill and suggest model tier
|arete skill route "<query>":Route to skill only (for agents before loading skill)
|arete brief --for "task" --skill <name>:Assemble primitive briefing (context + memory + entities + relationships)
|arete context --for "query":Get relevant workspace files for a task
|arete context --for "query" --inventory:Show context freshness dashboard with coverage gaps

|arete pull calendar [--today|--days N]:Pull calendar events
|arete pull fathom [--days N]:Pull Fathom recordings
|arete template resolve --skill <id> --variant <name>:Resolve and print the active template for a skill (workspace override > skill default)
|arete template resolve --skill <id> --variant <name> --path:Print resolved file path only
|arete template list [--skill <id>]:List all skill templates; shows which have active workspace overrides
|arete template view --skill <id> --variant <name>:View resolved template content with source annotation

[Skills]|root:.agents/skills
|execute-prd:{triggers:"User says Execute this PRD or Build everything in prd.json; multi-task PRDs with dependencies (3+ tasks); want autonomous execution with quality review",does:"Autonomous PRD execution with Orchestrator (Sr. Eng Manager) and Reviewer (Sr. Engineer). Includes pre-mortem, structured feedback, and holistic review."}
|plan-to-prd:{triggers:"User chose Convert to PRD when offered the PRD path in Plan Mode; after plan-pre-mortem rule offers the choice and user selects the PRD path",does:"Convert an approved plan into a PRD, prd.json, and handoff prompt for autonomous execution via execute-prd."}
|prd-to-json:{triggers:"Convert this PRD to JSON, Create prd.json from [PRD file], Prepare PRD for autonomous execution; after creating a PRD for an Areté feature you want to build autonomously",does:"Convert markdown PRD to JSON task list for autonomous execution. Reads build memory for context."}
|prd-post-mortem:{triggers:"After completing a PRD via execute-prd skill; user says Create the post-mortem or Extract learnings from this PRD; at end of PRD execution before closing",does:"Systematic post-mortem analysis after PRD execution. Analyzes outcomes, extracts learnings, synthesizes subagent reflections, and creates memory entry."}
|review-plan:{triggers:"Review this plan, Can you give me a second opinion on this?, Critique this PRD; when one agent creates work and another should evaluate it; before executing complex or high-stakes work",does:"Structured second-opinion review for plans, PRDs, or completed work. Applies checklist and devil's advocate perspective."}
|run-pre-mortem:{triggers:"Before executing approved plans (3+ steps or complex); before large refactors (touching many files); before new systems (integrations, providers, etc.)",does:"Run a pre-mortem risk analysis before starting multi-step work. Identifies risks across 8 categories and creates actionable mitigations."}
|synthesize-collaboration-profile:{triggers:"Builder asks to Synthesize collaboration profile or Update collaboration from entries; after PRD post-mortem; after several entries with learnings have accumulated (5+); after major build phase or quarterly review",does:"Review build entries' Learnings and Corrections, merge into memory/collaboration.md, and update the builder collaboration profile."}

[Rules]|auto-applied:.cursor/rules/
|dev.mdc:Quality gates, execution path decision tree, code review checklist, skill/rule change procedures, multi-IDE consistency, documentation planning.
|testing.mdc:Testing requirements: all code changes must include tests. TypeScript tests (`node:test` + `node:assert/strict`), Python tests (`unittest`), test structure (Arrange-Act-Assert), test mapping, quality gates (typecheck + test:all).
|plan-pre-mortem.mdc:Mandatory pre-mortem workflow when in Plan Mode or creating multi-step plans. Includes PRD gateway: offer PRD path for plans with 3+ steps, new systems, integrations, or large refactors.
