# PM Wisdom Registry

A catalog of product management concepts with agent prompt suggestions for contextual use. Agents (and users) can reference this registry to offer relevant wisdom at the right moment—before a PRD lock, during discovery, or when planning quarters and roadmaps. Each concept includes a name, description, source, when to use it, skills that reference it, and 2–3 natural-sounding prompts the agent can offer.

## Top 25 (High Priority)

*Concepts with highest impact and lowest effort—use these first.*

---

## Concept: "What am I getting wrong?"

**Description**: Invite pushback with this question instead of "Does this make sense?" The latter invites polite agreement; "What am I getting wrong?" surfaces blind spots and genuine concerns.

**Source**: Shreyas Doshi (Good PM, Great PM) and similar PM craft articles  
**Best for**: PRD reviews, discovery synthesis, roadmap stress-testing, any decision you’re about to lock  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd, discovery, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Before we lock this, want to ask 'What am I getting wrong?' to surface blind spots?"
- "Should I invite pushback with that question instead of 'Does this make sense?'"
- "Want to run a quick sanity check by explicitly asking what we might be missing?"

---

## Concept: Strategy kernel (diagnosis, policy, action)

**Description**: Good strategy has three parts: diagnosis (what's really going on), guiding policy (how we'll approach obstacles), and coherent action (coordinated steps). Use this to structure and stress-test strategy before execution.

**Source**: *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* by Richard Rumelt  
**Best for**: Quarter planning, PRD alignment, roadmap strategy, competitive positioning  
**Skills that use it**: quarter-plan, create-prd, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to check your strategy against the kernel—diagnosis, policy, action?"
- "Should we spell out the diagnosis and guiding policy before we lock tactics?"
- "Does this strategy have a clear diagnosis and coherent action, or is it mostly goals?"

---

## Concept: The Mom Test (don't pitch, past behavior, compliments are lies)

**Description**: Talk about their life and experience, not your idea; ask about specific past actions ("Tell me about the last time…") instead of hypotheticals ("Would you use…"); treat compliments as noise—dig for specifics.

**Source**: *The Mom Test* by Rob Fitzpatrick; *Competing Against Luck* (JTBD); Growth.Design psychology articles  
**Best for**: User interviews, discovery, customer feedback synthesis  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Before we talk to users, want to frame questions around their past behavior instead of hypotheticals?"
- "Should we avoid pitching and focus on their life and experience?"
- "Compliments are usually lies—want to dig for specifics instead?"

---

## Concept: Light pre-mortem for decisions

**Description**: Before locking a PRD, roadmap, or quarter outcome, assume it failed 6 months from now. What would have caused it? Surface 2–3 risks and one mitigation each.

**Source**: *Thinking in Bets* by Annie Duke  
**Best for**: PRDs, roadmaps, quarter planning, any high-stakes decision  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd, construct-roadmap, quarter-plan

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Before we finalize this, want to run a quick pre-mortem? Assume it failed—what would have caused it?"
- "Should we identify 2–3 risks that could derail this and one mitigation each?"
- "Want to stress-test this by pretending it already failed and working backwards?"

---

## Concept: Shipping is a feature / time value

**Description**: What ships is what matters—ship, learn, iterate. Product shipped earlier is worth more; scope and expectations grow the longer you delay. v1 should be a complete product, not a placeholder.

**Source**: Blackbox mental models; a16z/Gibson/Canopy/pmarchive articles  
**Best for**: PRDs, roadmaps, scope decisions, MVP definition  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Shipping is a feature—want to cut scope so we can ship sooner and learn?"
- "Should we treat v1 as a complete product that works if never improved?"
- "The longer we wait, the more scope creeps. Want to ruthlessly trim to ship sooner?"

---

## Concept: Version two is a lie

**Description**: Don't depend on v2. Ship v1 as a complete product that still works if it's never improved. "We'll fix it in v2" usually means it never ships or stays broken.

**Source**: Blackbox mental models  
**Best for**: PRD scope, MVP definition, roadmap commitments  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Version two is a lie—want to make sure v1 is complete and usable as-is?"
- "Should we cut anything that depends on 'we'll fix it later'?"
- "Anything we're deferring to v2 that we should bake into v1?"

---

## Concept: Disagree and commit

**Description**: Aim for clarity and commitment over consensus. Document disagreement, but everyone commits to the decision. Avoid passive "agree to disagree" dynamics that undermine execution.

**Source**: *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team* by Patrick Lencioni; *Scaling People*; Amazon culture  
**Best for**: Quarter planning, PRD sign-off, cross-functional alignment  
**Skills that use it**: quarter-plan, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to document any disagreement but still get everyone to commit?"
- "Should we aim for clarity and commitment rather than full consensus?"
- "Anyone disagree? Let's capture it and still commit to the path forward."

---

## Concept: "How can we do this in half the time?" prompt

**Description**: End planning with a ruthless question: there's always a way to ship faster. Forces scope cuts and prioritization.

**Source**: Blackbox mental models  
**Best for**: Roadmap planning, PRD scope, sprint/quarter commitments  
**Skills that use it**: construct-roadmap, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to ask 'How can we do this in half the time?' to force scope cuts?"
- "Should we pressure-test this plan by pretending we have half the time?"
- "Let's end with that question—what would we cut if we had to ship in half the time?"

---

## Concept: Argue the opposite / devil's advocate

**Description**: Stress-test decisions by arguing the opposite or assigning someone (or the agent) to do so. Surfaces blind spots and weak assumptions.

**Source**: Shreyas Doshi; *Thinking in Bets* by Annie Duke  
**Best for**: PRDs, roadmaps, strategy reviews, group decisions  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want me to play devil's advocate and challenge this approach?"
- "Should I argue the opposite case to test this?"
- "Want to stress-test this by having someone argue against it?"

---

## Concept: Confirmation bias (information phase)

**Description**: People seek evidence that confirms prior beliefs. Solution-first discovery favors confirming data; neutral inquiry surfaces disconfirming evidence. Be explicit about testing assumptions, not proving them.

**Source**: Growth.Design psychology articles; *Thinking in Bets*  
**Best for**: Discovery, user research, synthesis, PRD validation  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, create-prd, synthesize

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Are we testing assumptions or proving them? Want to look for disconfirming evidence?"
- "Should we explicitly seek evidence that would prove us wrong?"
- "Confirmation bias is sneaky—want to list what would falsify our hypothesis?"

---

## Concept: Behaviors over stated preferences

**Description**: What people actually do is more reliable than what they say they would do. Prioritize observation and past behavior over self-report and hypotheticals.

**Source**: Growth.Design; *The Mom Test*; *Competing Against Luck*  
**Best for**: Discovery, user research, synthesis, feature prioritization  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, synthesize

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to focus on what they actually do rather than what they say?"
- "Should we look for behavioral data instead of survey or interview intent?"
- "Their past behavior is usually more reliable than their predictions—want to dig into that?"

---

## Concept: Jobs-to-be-done (framing, template, dimensions)

**Description**: People "hire" products to make progress in specific circumstances. Use the template: When [situation], I want [motivation], so I can [outcome]. Jobs have functional, emotional, and social dimensions—discovery should surface all three.

**Source**: *Competing Against Luck* by Clayton Christensen; *The Jobs to Be Done Playbook*  
**Best for**: Discovery, PRD problem framing, feature prioritization  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to frame this as a jobs-to-be-done statement? When [situation], I want [motivation], so I can [outcome]."
- "Should we check functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the job?"
- "What job are they hiring this for? Want to spell that out explicitly?"

---

## Concept: Decide don't option

**Description**: PMs must decide, not add options. "Make it configurable" leads to combinatorics and unclear product. Pick a direction.

**Source**: a16z/pmarchive; Gibson/Canopy articles  
**Best for**: PRDs, roadmap scope, design decisions  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to decide rather than add options? 'Make it configurable' usually creates complexity."
- "Should we pick a clear direction instead of offering more choices?"
- "Are we deciding or deferring? Let's make the call."

---

## Concept: SMT and OKRs

**Description**: Strategy → Metrics → Tactics. Proxy metrics validate strategy; tactics bring strategy to life. Add forecast per quarter/year to turn SMT into OKRs; beware false precision.

**Source**: a16z/Gibson/Canopy articles  
**Best for**: Quarter planning, goals alignment, week planning, roadmap metrics  
**Skills that use it**: quarter-plan, construct-roadmap, goals-alignment, week-plan

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to check Strategy → Metrics → Tactics alignment before we lock OKRs?"
- "Do our tactics map to metrics that validate our strategy?"
- "Should we add a forecast to turn SMT into OKRs for this quarter?"

---

## Concept: Can't agree to disagree

**Description**: After a decision, bring people along. "Agree to disagree" often hides passive-aggressive dynamics. Get commitment, not passive compliance.

**Source**: a16z/pmarchive  
**Best for**: PRD sign-off, cross-functional alignment, stakeholder management  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to make sure nobody's 'agreeing to disagree' and then quietly blocking?"
- "Should we get explicit commitment rather than passive compliance?"
- "Anyone in 'agree to disagree' mode? Let's surface it and bring them along."

---

## Concept: Proxy metrics

**Description**: Leading indicators linked to outcomes. Must be measurable, moveable, non-average, correlated with outcomes, segmented (e.g. new vs existing), and not gameable.

**Source**: a16z/Gibson; SMT framework  
**Best for**: Quarter goals, PRD success metrics, roadmap tracking  
**Skills that use it**: quarter-plan, create-prd, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to validate our proxy metrics—measurable, moveable, segmented, not gameable?"
- "Do our metrics lead the outcome or lag it? Want to check?"
- "Should we run our metrics through the proxy checklist?"

---

## Concept: Build-Measure-Learn loop

**Description**: Shorten feedback cycles. Validated learning over vanity metrics. The fastest cycle wins. Build, measure, learn—then iterate.

**Source**: *The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries  
**Best for**: Discovery, PRD validation, experiments, product development  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to shorten the Build-Measure-Learn cycle so we learn faster?"
- "Are we optimizing for validated learning or vanity metrics?"
- "What's the smallest experiment we could run to test this?"

---

## Concept: Bad strategy patterns

**Description**: Bad strategy includes fluff, goals-as-strategy (mistaking goals for strategy), superficial objectives, and failing to address real obstacles. Good strategy has diagnosis, policy, and action.

**Source**: *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* by Richard Rumelt  
**Best for**: Quarter planning, strategy docs, PRD strategy section  
**Skills that use it**: quarter-plan, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to check for bad strategy patterns—fluff, goals-as-strategy, missing obstacles?"
- "Is this strategy or a list of goals? Let's stress-test it."
- "Are we actually addressing obstacles or just stating objectives?"

---

## Concept: Ruthless mindset for prioritization

**Description**: Accept reality: the perfect product is an illusion, trade-offs are required, and prioritization favors willingness to ship over polish. Be ruthless.

**Source**: Blackbox mental models  
**Best for**: Roadmap planning, PRD scope, backlog grooming  
**Skills that use it**: construct-roadmap, create-prd, discovery

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to adopt a ruthless mindset—ship over polish, trade-offs required?"
- "What would we cut if we had to ship this week?"
- "Perfect is the enemy of shipped—want to make the hard cuts?"

---

## Concept: Five dysfunctions pyramid check

**Description**: Before alignment, check: trust, productive conflict, commitment, accountability, results focus. Alignment without these foundations is shallow.

**Source**: *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team* by Patrick Lencioni  
**Best for**: Goals alignment, quarter planning, team health  
**Skills that use it**: quarter-plan, goals-alignment

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to run the Five Dysfunctions check before we align on goals?"
- "Do we have trust and productive conflict before we lock commitment?"
- "Quick check: trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, results—where are we strong or weak?"

---

## Concept: DHM model

**Description**: Strategy = delighting customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. Three dimensions: Delight, Hard-to-copy, Margin. Use this to assess whether your strategy creates sustainable value.

**Source**: Ben Horowitz; a16z/pmarchive  
**Best for**: PRD strategy, competitive analysis, quarter strategy  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd, quarter-plan, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to check this against DHM—delighting customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways?"
- "Is our strategy delighting, hard-to-copy, and margin-enhancing?"
- "Should we run our value prop through the DHM lens?"

---

## Concept: Market pulls product / Rachleff's Law / PMF signals

**Description**: Lack of market is the main failure mode. A strong market pulls a viable product; product only needs to be good enough. PMF signals: fast adoption, growth, inbound interest. Weak signals: no word of mouth, slow growth.

**Source**: Andy Rachleff; a16z; Gibson/Canopy  
**Best for**: Discovery, PRD viability, competitive analysis  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, create-prd, competitive-analysis

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to check PMF signals—are we seeing pull or push?"
- "Rachleff's Law: lack of market is the main failure. Are we feeling pull?"
- "Do we have word of mouth and inbound interest, or are we pushing?"

---

## Rest of Concepts (Alphabetical)

---

## Concept: 10% better can be 100% different

**Description**: Small "polish" changes can disrupt UX. Existing users may not notice or want them; new users might love them. Assess if the improvement is worth the risk before shipping.

**Source**: a16z/Gibson/Canopy  
**Best for**: Roadmap decisions, UX changes, product evolution  
**Skills that use it**: construct-roadmap, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "10% better can feel 100% different to users—want to check if this change helps or hurts current users?"
- "Could this polish disrupt existing workflows? Should we assess?"
- "Small changes, big impact—want to think through who wins and who loses?"

---

## Concept: 7 Powers / hard-to-copy advantage

**Description**: Assess defensibility using seven powers: Brand, Network effects, Economies of scale, Counter-positioning, Unique tech, Switching costs, Process power, Captured resource. Use to evaluate competitive moats.

**Source**: a16z; *7 Powers* by Hamilton Helmer  
**Best for**: Competitive analysis, PRD defensibility, strategy  
**Skills that use it**: competitive-analysis, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to assess our defensibility using the 7 Powers framework?"
- "Which of these powers do we have—or could we build?"
- "Should we map our moat to Brand, Network effects, Switching costs, etc.?"

---

## Concept: Alignment proxies trap

**Description**: Goals, OKRs, and priority lists are proxies, not alignment. The system shifts constantly—rely on understanding and shared mental models, not just commitment to artifacts.

**Source**: Shreyas Doshi; Cutler; Noah; Peled  
**Best for**: Quarter planning, goals alignment, week planning  
**Skills that use it**: quarter-plan, goals-alignment

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Are we conflating the artifact (OKRs) with actual alignment? Want to check understanding?"
- "Goals are proxies—do we have shared understanding behind them?"
- "Let's make sure we're aligned, not just committed to the same doc."

---

## Concept: Anchoring and framing effects

**Description**: The first piece of information and how options are presented strongly shape decisions. Be aware of anchors in discovery, prioritization, and stakeholder conversations.

**Source**: Growth.Design psychology articles  
**Best for**: Discovery, PRD reviews, roadmap prioritization  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, create-prd, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Could the first thing we heard be anchoring us? Want to reconsider with fresh framing?"
- "How we frame the options shapes the answer—want to reframe and see if it changes?"
- "Let's check if we're anchored. What if we'd heard the opposite first?"

---

## Concept: Antifragile design (optionality)

**Description**: Favor designs and options that benefit from stress and volatility, not just resist them. Build optionality so upside compounds and downside is bounded.

**Source**: *Antifragile* by Nassim Taleb  
**Best for**: Roadmap planning, architecture decisions, discovery  
**Skills that use it**: construct-roadmap, discovery

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to design for antifragility—benefit from volatility, not just survive it?"
- "Could we add optionality so we gain from stress?"
- "Are we building something that gets stronger under pressure?"

---

## Concept: Availability heuristic and recency

**Description**: Recent or easy-to-recall information is overweighted. Affects synthesis, prioritization, and memory. Actively seek older or less salient data.

**Source**: Growth.Design psychology articles  
**Best for**: Synthesis, discovery, roadmap prioritization  
**Skills that use it**: synthesize, discovery

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Are we overweighting recent feedback? Want to check older data?"
- "The availability heuristic—what's easiest to recall might dominate. Should we correct for that?"
- "Let's make sure we're not over-indexing on the last thing we heard."

---

## Concept: Barbell strategy for risk

**Description**: Combine low-risk work (e.g., 90%) with high-risk bets (e.g., 10%) instead of spreading risk evenly. Protects downside while enabling upside.

**Source**: *Antifragile* by Nassim Taleb  
**Best for**: Roadmap planning, quarter planning, portfolio decisions  
**Skills that use it**: construct-roadmap, quarter-plan

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to use a barbell—mostly safe bets, with a few high-risk moonshots?"
- "Are we spreading risk evenly when we could protect 90% and bet big on 10%?"
- "Should we separate 'keep the lights on' from 'big bets'?"

---

## Concept: Bug prioritization system

**Description**: Use frequency × severity to triage; define thresholds for "too severe" and "too frequent"; include "backlog and do nothing" as a valid option.

**Source**: Blackbox mental models  
**Best for**: Roadmap triage, backlog management, support escalations  
**Skills that use it**: construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to triage bugs with frequency × severity?"
- "Should we define 'too severe' and 'too frequent' thresholds?"
- "Including 'do nothing' as an option prevents backlog creep—want to use that?"

---

## Concept: Calibrated questions for discovery

**Description**: Use questions like "How am I supposed to do that?" to surface constraints, blockers, and context. Open-ended, inviting elaboration without leading.

**Source**: *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss  
**Best for**: User interviews, discovery, meeting prep  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, meeting-prep

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to use calibrated questions like 'How am I supposed to do that?' to dig deeper?"
- "Should we avoid yes/no and ask questions that invite them to elaborate?"
- "Questions that start with 'How' or 'What' usually surface more—want to try a few?"

---

## Concept: Cognitive empathy and inner thinking mapping

**Description**: Understand others' reasoning, mental models, and motives without necessarily agreeing. Map the internal beliefs and trade-offs behind behavior, not just behaviors.

**Source**: *Practical Empathy*; *Never Split the Difference*  
**Best for**: Discovery, synthesis, stakeholder understanding  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, synthesize

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to map their inner thinking—what they believe and why—not just what they said?"
- "Should we understand their mental model before we propose solutions?"
- "Cognitive empathy: what's their reasoning? Let's map it."

---

## Concept: Confidence/assumption spectrum for speed vs quality

**Description**: Low confidence → ship fast to learn; high confidence → invest in quality. Match your process to where you are on the spectrum.

**Source**: Blackbox mental models  
**Best for**: Discovery, PRDs, roadmap scope  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, create-prd, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Where are we on the confidence spectrum? Low confidence → ship fast; high → invest in quality."
- "Should we speed up because we're still learning, or slow down because we're confident?"
- "Let's match our approach to our confidence level."

---

## Concept: Data fluency

**Description**: Define and track the right metrics, align the org around them, design solid experiments, and know when optimization isn't worth it.

**Source**: Shreyas Doshi; Cutler; data-driven PM articles  
**Best for**: PRDs, discovery, roadmap metrics  
**Skills that use it**: create-prd, discovery, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to check our data fluency—right metrics, solid experiments, org alignment?"
- "Are we optimizing something that's not worth optimizing?"
- "Do we have the right metrics and the right experiments to validate them?"

---

## Concept: Delegation levels framework

**Description**: Clarify autonomy levels from "do what I say" to "you decide" for each stakeholder or project. Avoid ambiguity about who owns what.

**Source**: *Scaling People*; *Never Split the Difference*  
**Best for**: Meeting prep, quarter planning, stakeholder alignment  
**Skills that use it**: meeting-prep, quarter-plan

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Want to clarify delegation levels—'do what I say' vs 'you decide'—for this project?"
- "Should we align on who has final say before we dive in?"
- "What level of autonomy does each person have here? Let's make it explicit."

---

## Concept: Discovery vs delivery

**Description**: Discovery de-risks before delivery. Run continuous discovery (value, usability, feasibility, viability) before building. Don't skip discovery for speed.

**Source**: *Inspired* / *Empowered* by Marty Cagan; Teresa Torres  
**Best for**: PRD process, roadmap, product development  
**Skills that use it**: discovery, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Are we in discovery or delivery? Want to de-risk before we build?"
- "Discovery de-risks—value, usability, feasibility, viability. Have we checked all four?"
- "Should we run more discovery before we lock the roadmap?"

---

## Concept: Empowered teams (outcomes, not outputs)

**Description**: Empower product teams to own outcomes and solve problems, not just execute a fixed roadmap of features. Outputs are a means; outcomes are the goal.

**Source**: *Empowered* by Marty Cagan  
**Best for**: Quarter planning, roadmap, team structure  
**Skills that use it**: quarter-plan, construct-roadmap

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
- "Are we giving them outcomes to own, or a list of outputs to build?"
- "Want to shift from 'here's what to build' to 'here's the outcome we need'?"
- "Empowered = outcomes. Are we there?"

---

## Concept: Expected value (probability-weighted outcomes)

**Description**: Compare options by probability-weighted value. Include "takes longer" and "fails" as outcomes. EV = P(success) × Value(success) + P(fail) × Value(fail).

**Source**: Blackbox mental models; *Thinking in Bets*  
**Best for**: Roadmap prioritization, PRD decisions, portfolio allocation  
**Skills that use it**: construct-roadmap, create-prd

**Agent prompt suggestions**:
