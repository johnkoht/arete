## The Universal Framework

Every source converges on essentially the same three-phase arc:

| Phase | Theme | Mindset |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Days 1–30** | Learn & Listen | Absorb like a sponge. Resist the urge to act. |
| **Days 31–60** | Contribute & Build Credibility | Land quick wins. Start demonstrating judgment. |
| **Days 61–90** | Own & Lead | Ship something. Establish yourself as a go-to person. |

The phases overlap intentionally—you never stop learning, and you may start contributing before day 30. The framework is a center-of-gravity guide, not a hard cutoff.

---

## Phase 1: Days 1–30 — Discovery

### Core Principle
Treat your first 30 days as a **discovery sprint** (Ant Murphy's framing). Just as you wouldn't ship a product without discovery, don't take action without context. The 2–4 week mark is the sweet spot between learning too long and executing too early.

### Two Traps to Avoid (UserVoice)
1. **The Documentation Hole** — Getting lost in wikis, Confluence pages, and onboarding docs at your desk. It doesn't build relationships or credibility, and gives a disengaged impression.
2. **Coming In Hot** — Making proclamations and challenging norms before understanding why they exist. Even if everyone hates the current process, you haven't earned the right to critique it yet.

### What to Learn (Ant Murphy's 4-Category Matrix)

| Category | Key Questions |
|----------|--------------|
| **Product Management Craft** | How does PM work here? What are my strengths/gaps relative to this role? What's different from my last job? |
| **The Product** | Vision, strategy, roadmap, goals, target customer, product metrics, existing customer feedback, technical architecture. |
| **The Market** | Competitors, market trends, segments, TAM/SAM, industry dynamics. |
| **The Business** | Business strategy, how your product fits, revenue model, other products in portfolio, company values and governance. |

### Two Backlogs to Create

**1. Learning Backlog**
For each item, capture: What do I need to learn? → Why? → Who can I learn it from? → How will I get the information?

**2. Relationship Backlog / Stakeholder Map**
For each person: Who are they? → Why is this relationship important? → How will I build and maintain it?

This produces a "hit list" of people to meet in week 1–2, and it helps you establish a recurring meeting cadence from the start (e.g., "can we do a biweekly 1:1?" at your first meeting).

### Ken Norton's Three Pillars: People, Product, Personal (Bring the Donuts)
Ken Norton (ex-Google, GV) organizes the first 30 days around three pillars:

**People:**
- Schedule a 1:1 with everyone on the team. Walking 1:1s > sitting across a table.
- Ask the 9 magic words: **"What can I do to make your life easier?"** This single question demonstrates you're there to help, reveals how people perceive the PM role, and surfaces real needs.
- Take a load off someone's back. Even if you're not technical enough to fix bugs, you can document something, write something, or take an admin burden off a teammate.

**Product:**
- Walk through the technical architecture in deep detail with your lead engineer.
- Spend time with users: go on sales calls, take support tickets, get on forums.
- Hold back on making changes. Your ideas will be better formed after you've settled in. Demonstrating you're a listener is more valuable than proving you're smart.

**Personal:**
- Read everything: old OKRs, specs, design docs, wiki pages. Write it if it doesn't exist.
- Fix a bug or launch a tiny feature yourself. Set up a dev environment and ask for something bite-sized. This builds technical credibility fast.
- Understand the company's overall strategy — is it targeting acquisition, IPO, or growth? Product initiatives vary dramatically based on this context.

### "Create Leverage" Through Documentation (Product Lessons / Linda Zhang)
If you're a doer who feels weird not producing anything, here's an underrated outlet: **document what you learn as you learn it.** This serves three audiences: (1) yourself — writing clarifies thinking, (2) your manager — signaling learnings and inviting edits builds trust, (3) future new hires — the best onboarding doc is written by someone who recently onboarded, not the most tenured person.

One example: creating a data dictionary capturing how engineers structured their databases. It became the most up-to-date reference and was widely circulated. The no-BS definition of "creating leverage" is: what can I say or do *once* that can be used over and over?

### Breadth Over Depth (Product Lessons / Linda Zhang)
It's tempting to fall down a rabbit hole and make it your sole focus. It feels productive and reassuring. But you can't develop good judgment without broader context. The first 30 days is a rare window to gain that breadth — meeting people, mapping the business equation, and using the product with fresh eyes.

### Key Activities

- **Run a listening tour.** Schedule 1:1s with everyone: PMs, engineers, designers, sales, marketing, CS, support, leadership. Focus on listening, not talking. Ask every person: "What's the biggest challenge this role/team faces?" and "Who else should I talk to?"
- **Use the product.** Deeply. Go through onboarding as a new user. Explore edge cases. No excuses about not being the target user.
- **Talk to customers early.** Before your own biases set in. Shadow sales calls, listen to support calls, read NPS/CSAT data. If possible, sit in on customer interviews.
- **Learn the tools.** Jira, Figma, Notion, Slack channels, analytics dashboards—get comfortable fast.
- **Understand existing metrics.** What KPIs does the team track? How has the product performed against them? Where are the gaps?
- **Learn how decisions get made.** Formal structures and informal power networks. Who are decision-makers? Who resists change? Who are early adopters?
- **Learn your manager's style.** Communication preferences, expectations for the first 90 days, how they like to assign work.

### The "Diagnose, Don't Solve" Framing (Shreyas Doshi)
When your manager says "just spend time learning," go a step further: ask them "Is there a burning problem on the team that you'd like me to at least investigate and diagnose?" Frame it explicitly as diagnosis, not a commitment to solve — this removes the guilt managers feel about assigning tasks to new hires. Collect 2–3 such problems from your manager, engineering lead, and design counterpart. This gives you:
- A signal of what's actually important and urgent to the team
- A way to build credibility intentionally, not randomly
- Context that reading docs alone can't provide

**The anti-pattern:** A new PM aggregates user feedback in their first week and dumps a list of "user asks" on the team. The intention is good, but the team's reaction is "great, this new PM just put more work on us" — or worse, it feels condescending to people who've been working on the product for years. Let the right people flag the problems for you, then investigate.

### Don't Assign Action Items in Your First 1:1s (Shreyas Doshi)
PMs have a bad habit of assigning action items everywhere they go. In your early meetings, focus on understanding: What do they care most deeply about? What problems do they see? What's been tried before that didn't work? What working style do they prefer? Subtly share your empathy for their discipline — showing you understand how engineering or design works builds credibility without bragging.

### Pro Move: Start Before Day 1

### End-of-Phase Milestone
Conduct a **"situational conversation"** (Michael Watkins concept via Ant Murphy): Play back everything you've learned to your manager and key stakeholders. Validate whether your observations align with theirs. This demonstrates synthesis ability and catches blind spots.

## Phase 2: Days 31–60 — Quick Wins & Credibility

### Core Principle
Transition from listening to executing—but be intentional about **what** you execute first. Quick wins build one of the core components of trust: **demonstrated competency**. Aim for things that take no more than a few weeks, and that are actually important to the organization.

### Key Activities

- **Demo the product internally.** Prove you understand how things work by presenting the product to your team. It surfaces your knowledge gaps and shows commitment. (UserVoice)
- **Run a retro on a recent release.** Even one that pre-dates you. Your outsider perspective is an asset—people are more comfortable in retros with someone who wasn't involved. (UserVoice)
- **Identify and fix a small, visible problem.** Look for friction that's been accepted as normal. Don't try to change everything—focus on a core piece of functionality that will make a noticeable impact. (UserVoice: "Attack something significant that can be done and achieved in 30 days.")
- **Immerse yourself in the tech.** This is the window to go deep on architecture and technical constraints—you'll be too busy later. Show engineers you care about how things are built, not just what ships.
- **Start taking ownership of ceremonies.** Run a sprint planning session, lead a standup, facilitate a prioritization discussion. You don't need all the strategic answers yet—just show you can keep things on track.
- **Have the "expectations" conversation.** Proactively align with your manager and head of product on near-term strategic priorities.

### Watch Out: Imposter Syndrome
The transition from pure learning to performing is when imposter syndrome hits hardest. This is normal and expected. Nearly every source acknowledges this.

### Trust Is a Battery, Not a Switch (Product Lessons / Linda Zhang)
Trust isn't binary (they trust me or they don't). It's more like a battery — it starts empty and grows with every interaction. By starting with small but undeniable value, you kickstart your trust battery. This sets you up to reach the trust level required to make bigger changes later.

### Ideal Starter Project Criteria (Product Lessons / Linda Zhang)
The right debut project is:
- **Fast & achievable:** Clear results within 2–3 weeks
- **Visible:** Clearly helps the business or the people
- **Low-risk:** Avoid controversial changes to start
- **Gut check:** "Nobody owns this, but we strongly believe we need to do it"

### The Say/Do Ratio (Deb Liu)
People watch your say/do ratio closely. The best way to build trust is to make a commitment and deliver on it. Publish your priorities, share progress against them, and hold yourself accountable. People also want to see that you pivot when you learn something new — flexibility is a strength, not a weakness.

### Quick Win Ideas from Operators (Lenny's / Kyle Poyar)
These are more tactical/growth-focused, but the pattern applies to any PM looking for early impact:

- **Audit existing funnels** for low-hanging fruit (even small copy changes can unlock meaningful metrics)
- **Look at what "everyone knows" with fresh eyes**—beginner's mind reveals opportunities the team has overlooked
- **Fix an annoying workflow** that the team has adapted to but shouldn't have
- **Create or improve a recurring artifact** (status update template, stakeholder brief, decision log)
- **Surface a data insight** that changes how the team thinks about a problem

The best quick wins share a trait: they're **hiding in plain sight**. Your fresh perspective is your superpower here.

## Phase 3: Days 61–90 — Own & Ship

### Core Principle
Become the go-to person in your product area. By now you should understand customers, product, strategy, business model, competitors, metrics, and trends well enough to make real strategic contributions.

### Key Activities

- **Own a small initiative end-to-end.** Identify a new feature or enhancement, work with the team from ideation through shipping. This lets you establish processes (sprint cadence, roadmap updates, stakeholder communication) that you'll scale to bigger projects later.
- **Formulate and share your product POV.** Based on your research, start articulating hypotheses about where the product should go. Back them up with data and customer evidence.
- **Propose roadmap ideas.** Come with at least 10 improvement ideas for quarterly/annual planning. Show how they connect to strategy and customer needs.
- **Establish regular communication rhythms.** Stakeholder updates, product changelogs, team syncs. Make your work and your team's progress visible.
- **Conduct a gap analysis.** Where is the product vs. where it needs to be? Start mapping the opportunity space.
- **Build a Product Management Playbook.** Begin documenting how you'll run your product area—processes, decision frameworks, meeting structures.

### Know the Why Before You Propose the How (Product Lessons / Linda Zhang)
Before making any change, understand why something is the way it is. Talk to the people who built what you want to change — are they on the same page about the problem? Do they agree now is the right time? How involved do they want to be? Nobody likes to be surprised in a group meeting.

### Navigate Sacred Cows (Product Lessons / Linda Zhang)
Every org has sacred cows — long-held assumptions about customers, the product, or processes. While there's a time to challenge them, it's unlikely to go well in the first 90 days. If you find an org resistant to change, try reframing: instead of "What's broken, and how do we fix it?" ask **"What's working, and how can we do more of it?"** Native solutions escape the usual skepticism, are easier to roll out, and require less context to identify.

### Peacetime vs. Wartime Onboarding (Deb Liu)
The Learn → Align → Execute arc works well if you're joining during "peacetime" — when you'll have the luxury of onboarding methodically. If you're joining during "wartime" (a crisis, a pivot, a turnaround), you may need to compress or reorder the phases to get into action faster. Know which situation you're in.

### End-of-Phase Milestone
You've shipped something real, however small. You've established working relationships across the org. People come to you for product questions about your area. You have a point of view on where the product should go next.

## Cross-Cutting Best Practices (Applies to All Phases)

### Relationships Are the Job
Every source emphasizes this. PM is a role where influence > authority. You don't have a team that reports to you—you have a team you need to earn the right to lead.

- Schedule 1:1s proactively. Don't wait for others to reach out.
- Meet people outside your immediate team and department.
- Use the "I'm new here" card while it lasts—it opens doors faster than anything else.
- Map stakeholders by power/interest and tailor your engagement.

### Listen More Than You Talk (Especially Early)
- The ratio should start at ~80/20 listen/talk in month 1, shifting toward 50/50 by month 3.
- Ask the same 3 benchmark questions to everyone (e.g., "biggest challenge for this role," "company's biggest strength," "what would you change if you could"). This reveals patterns and dissonance.
- Don't call them interviews—call them "coffee catchups."

### Share Your Plan Widely (Enhanced by Deb Liu)
- Write down your 30/60/90 plan and share it with your manager for feedback.
- **Then share it more broadly.** Deb Liu (CEO of Ancestry) shared a detailed draft with her leadership team for input, then published a high-level summary to the entire company. This transparency ensures everyone understands your priorities, timeframe, and commitments.
- Update it weekly. Treat it as a living document.
- This signals that you're forward-thinking, organized, and coachable.
- A shared plan creates mutual accountability — it's harder for expectations to drift when they're written down and visible.

### Be a Sponge, Not a Know-It-All
- Resist projecting what worked at your last company onto this one.
- Context matters enormously. The same playbook almost never works twice.
- Earn the right to challenge norms by first respecting and understanding them.

### Set Up Your Personal Operating System Early
- Note-taking system (whatever works—Notion, Obsidian, Apple Notes)
- Personal Kanban or task management
- A way to capture and organize the firehose of links, docs, and resources you'll receive
- Meeting notes system with clear follow-up tracking

### Track Your Progress with SMART Goals
Frame your plan items as specific, measurable outcomes. "Learn the product" → "Be able to deliver an end-to-end product demo highlighting the 3 most recent features by day 30."

### "Because" vs. "Despite" (Product Lessons / Linda Zhang)
Outsiders explain things with "because" — their product is winning *because* the team is genius. Insiders know that "because" is often a disguise for "despite" — their product is winning *despite* problems with the team. This is normal. Successful businesses thrive despite their many problems. Their problems can be your opportunity — but there's no time to take every one. Be intentional about which problems you adopt.

### Seek Feedback and Demonstrate Vulnerability
Demonstrating vulnerability early on makes everyone comfortable sharing feedback with you. Ask for it actively and continuously — don't wait for formal reviews. It also helps manage the overwhelm: there will be endless opportunities to jump in, learn, and solve. Set up a sustainable pace rather than sprinting into burnout. (Vijay Anand, commenting on Deb Liu's post)

| Operating in a silo | Puts you behind on influence and relationships—the core of the PM role |
| Skipping customer conversations | Leads to uninformed decisions and missed opportunities |
| Neglecting your manager relationship | Their perception of you is the most critical variable in your success |
| Trying to boil the ocean | Do one thing well before trying to change everything |
| Not writing your plan down | You lose clarity, accountability, and a chance to signal competence |
| Ignoring the informal power structure | Formal org charts don't tell you who really influences decisions |

Based on this research, a 30/60/90 skill could include:

1. **Plan Generator** — Guided prompts that produce a personalized 30/60/90 plan based on the PM's context (company stage, team size, IC vs. leadership role, domain familiarity, peacetime vs. wartime)
2. **Learning Backlog Template** — Pre-populated with the 4-category matrix (PM Craft, Product, Market, Business) and guided questions
3. **Relationship Backlog Template** — Stakeholder mapping with power/interest grid and relationship maintenance cadence; includes the "hit list" of first-week meetings
4. **"Burning Problems" Collector** — Template for capturing 2–3 high-leverage problems flagged by manager, eng lead, and design counterpart (diagnose, don't solve)
5. **Weekly Check-In** — Structured reflection prompts for each phase: What did I learn? What quick wins are available? What should I do next week? What's my say/do ratio looking like?
6. **Milestone Checklists** — Phase-specific checklists with SMART-formatted goals
7. **"Situational Conversation" Prep** — Template for the end-of-month-1 playback to your manager
8. **Quick Win Finder** — Prompts to help identify low-effort, high-impact opportunities from your discovery notes, using Linda Zhang's criteria (fast, visible, low-risk, unowned)
9. **Leverage Doc Starter** — Template for documenting learnings as you go (data dictionaries, process maps, glossaries) that serve triple duty: self-clarity, manager trust-building, and future onboarding docs
10. **Shareable Plan Summary** — A Deb Liu-inspired one-pager format for publishing your priorities, timeframe, and commitments to your broader team/org
