## Task 1 — Package structure + Lovable import (2026-03-04)

**Status**: Complete | **Commit**: 82d56e4

**What was done**:
- Cloned `https://github.com/johnkoht/meeting-minder` into `packages/apps/web/`, removed `.git` to incorporate into monorepo
- Created `packages/apps/backend/` with `package.json` (`@arete/backend`), `tsconfig.json` (extends `../../../tsconfig.base.json`, NodeNext), and `src/index.ts` placeholder
- Ran `npm install` inside `packages/apps/backend/` — installed all deps including `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `@arete/core` (file:), `gray-matter`, `yaml`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
- Added `dev:web`, `dev:backend`, `build:apps` convenience scripts to root `package.json`
- Did NOT add backend to root `tsc -b` references (correct: backend builds separately)

**Files changed**:
- `package.json` — added 3 convenience scripts
- `packages/apps/backend/package.json` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/tsconfig.json` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/src/index.ts` — new placeholder
- `packages/apps/web/` — cloned from meeting-minder (94 files)

**Quality checks**: typecheck ✓ | tests ✓ (1235 passed, 2 skipped)

**Reflection**: The pre-specified patterns (no workspace conversion, file: deps, no root tsconfig reference for apps) made the implementation straightforward. SSH clone fallback needed when HTTPS auth was unavailable. ~4K tokens.

## Task 2 — Meeting file data model + core utilities (2026-03-04)

**Status**: Complete | **Commit**: b603036

**What was done**:
- Added `StagedItemStatus`, `StagedItemEdits`, `StagedItem`, `StagedSections` types to `packages/core/src/models/integrations.ts` and exported from the barrel
- Updated `MeetingForSave` interface to include `status?: 'synced' | 'processed' | 'approved'`
- Updated `saveMeetingFile` to write `status: synced` and structured `attendees` array (name/email objects) to frontmatter using `yaml.stringify` for round-trip safety
- Created `packages/core/src/integrations/staged-items.ts` with all 5 required exports: `generateItemId`, `parseStagedSections`, `parseStagedItemStatus`, `writeItemStatusToFile`, `commitApprovedItems`
- Exported all utilities from `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- Created `packages/core/test/integrations/staged-items.test.ts` with 22 tests (19 numbered + 3 additional edge cases)

**Files changed**:
- `packages/core/src/models/integrations.ts` — added 4 staged-item types
- `packages/core/src/models/index.ts` — exported new types from barrel
- `packages/core/src/integrations/meetings.ts` — added `status` to `MeetingForSave`; refactored frontmatter to use `yaml.stringify`; structured attendees
- `packages/core/src/integrations/staged-items.ts` — new file with all utilities
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` — added staged-items exports
- `packages/core/test/integrations/staged-items.test.ts` — new (22 tests)
- `packages/core/src/integrations/LEARNINGS.md` — added Staged Items Pattern section

**Quality checks**: typecheck ✓ | tests ✓ (1258 tests total, 1256 passed, 2 skipped)

## Task 3 — Backend server + API endpoints (2026-03-04)

**Status**: Complete | **Commit**: d941e6e

**What was done**:
- Created `packages/apps/backend/src/types.ts` — `MeetingSummary` and `FullMeeting` types
- Created `packages/apps/backend/src/services/jobs.ts` — in-memory job store with `createJob`, `getJob`, `appendEvent`, `setJobStatus`
- Created `packages/apps/backend/src/services/workspace.ts` — meeting file operations: list, get, delete (with QMD refresh), update, updateItemStatus, approveMeeting. Uses `gray-matter` for parsing and `@arete/core` for FSA calls.
- Created `packages/apps/backend/src/routes/meetings.ts` — all `/api/meetings` endpoints including per-slug write queue for concurrency safety
- Created `packages/apps/backend/src/routes/jobs.ts` — `GET /api/jobs/:id`
- Created `packages/apps/backend/src/server.ts` — Hono app factory with CORS, health, route mounting, error handler
- Updated `packages/apps/backend/src/index.ts` — entry point with env validation and `@hono/node-server`
- Added `test` script to `packages/apps/backend/package.json`
- Created `packages/apps/backend/test/routes/meetings.test.ts` — 16 tests covering all routes with mocked services

**Files changed**:
- `packages/apps/backend/src/types.ts` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/src/services/jobs.ts` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/src/services/workspace.ts` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/src/routes/meetings.ts` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/src/routes/jobs.ts` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/src/server.ts` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/src/index.ts` — replaced placeholder
- `packages/apps/backend/package.json` — added test script
- `packages/apps/backend/test/routes/meetings.test.ts` — new (16 tests)

**Quality checks**: backend typecheck ✓ | backend tests ✓ (16 passed) | root typecheck ✓ | root tests ✓ (1256 passed, 2 skipped)

**Reflection**: The pre-specified patterns (Hono factory, per-slug write queue, gray-matter vs yaml, FileStorageAdapter for core calls) kept implementation focused. The main gotcha was `WriteItemStatusOptions` not being re-exported from `@arete/core/index.ts` — had to define it inline in the workspace service. The test approach of building a mock Hono app with injected service mocks (rather than filesystem mocking) was clean and fast. ~8K tokens estimated.

## Task 4 — Pi SDK agent integration for meeting processing (2026-03-04)

**Status**: Complete | **Commit**: 4babadf

**What was done**:
- Created `packages/apps/backend/src/services/agent.ts` — `runProcessingSession(workspaceRoot, meetingSlug, jobId, jobs)` wraps the Pi SDK: checks API key, creates in-memory session, subscribes to `message_update` (text_delta) and `tool_execution_start` events, awaits `session.prompt()`, sets job status to `done` or `error`
- Replaced `POST /api/meetings/:slug/process` stub — now checks API key (503 if missing), creates job, fires `runProcessingSession` and returns 202 immediately
- Replaced `GET /api/meetings/:slug/process-stream` stub — real SSE polling loop using `ReadableStream + setInterval`, slices job events and closes on done/error
- Created `packages/apps/backend/test/services/agent.test.ts` — 7 tests covering: API key missing, text delta event, tool_execution_start event, successful completion, thrown error, unsubscribe after success, unsubscribe after error

**Files changed**:
- `packages/apps/backend/src/services/agent.ts` — new
- `packages/apps/backend/src/routes/meetings.ts` — replaced process and process-stream stubs
- `packages/apps/backend/test/services/agent.test.ts` — new (7 tests)
- `packages/apps/backend/LEARNINGS.md` — added Pi SDK Integration section

**Quality checks**: backend typecheck ✓ | backend tests ✓ (23/23) | root typecheck ✓ | root tests ✓ (1256 passed, 2 skipped)

**Key discovery**: The Pi SDK's `AssistantMessageEvent.text_delta` shape is `{ type: 'text_delta', delta: string }` — NOT the raw Anthropic `content_block_delta` structure the task prompt described. The task prompt's event handling snippet was wrong; had to fix it based on actual type inspection.

**Reflection**: The Pi SDK type verification changed the event-handling logic significantly — the task prompt's suggested code would have failed typecheck. Inspecting the actual `.d.ts` files before implementing was essential. The fire-and-forget pattern and SSE polling pattern both worked cleanly. The testable design (injecting `apiKeyFn` and `createSession` as params) was straightforward to test without ES module mocking. ~6K tokens.

## Task 4 — Test accuracy fix (2026-03-04)

**Status**: Fixed | **Commit**: 1b1de0f

**What was fixed**:
The inline `runProcessingSessionTestable` function in `test/services/agent.test.ts` used the raw Anthropic `content_block_delta` shape (`ame.type === 'content_block_delta' && ame.delta.type === 'text_delta'`) instead of the Pi SDK normalized shape (`ame.type === 'text_delta'`, `ame.delta` as string directly). The emitted test event matched this wrong shape, so the "text delta appended" test passed but was not exercising the same logic as the production handler.

Fixed both:
1. `message_update` case in `runProcessingSessionTestable` — now matches production: `ame?.type === 'text_delta'` and `ame.delta as string`
2. Emitted test event — changed from nested Anthropic raw shape to Pi SDK normalized shape: `{ type: 'text_delta', delta: 'Hello world', contentIndex: 0, partial: {} }`

**Quality checks**: tests ✓ (23/23)

## Task 3 — Fix (2026-03-04)

**Status**: Fixed | **Commit**: b2f8e75

**What was fixed**:
1. **DELETE route missing `withSlugLock`** — wrapped `workspaceService.deleteMeeting` call in `withSlugLock` to prevent read-modify-write races if a PATCH is in-flight when DELETE fires.
2. **LEARNINGS.md invariant** — updated "All write operations (PATCH, PUT, approve)" to include DELETE.
3. **Unused imports** — removed `mock` and `beforeEach` from test file imports (were imported but never used).
4. **Unused `yaml` dep** — removed from `package.json`; the backend uses `gray-matter`, not `yaml` directly.

**Quality checks**: typecheck ✓ | tests ✓ (16/16)

## Task 5 — Wire web app to backend API (2026-03-04)

**Status**: Complete | **Commit**: 3941ea5

**What was done**:
- Created `src/api/types.ts` — frontend-normalized types (MeetingStatus, Attendee with initials, ReviewItem, JobResponse)
- Created `src/api/client.ts` — base fetch wrapper reading `VITE_API_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:3847`), throws on non-2xx with backend error message
- Created `src/api/meetings.ts` — all typed API functions; handles all shape mismatches in the API layer: attendee initials computation, duration string→number parsing, status lowercase→capitalized normalization, staged item type mapping (ai/de/le→action/decision/learning), flat ReviewItem list from `stagedSections` + `stagedItemStatus` + `staged_item_edits` from frontmatter
- Created `src/hooks/meetings.ts` — useMeetings, useMeeting, useApproveItem, useSaveApprove, useProcessPeople, useProcessMeeting, useSyncKrisp, useJobStatus (TanStack Query v5, polls every 2s while running)
- Updated `AvatarStack.tsx`, `MetadataPanel.tsx`, `ReviewItems.tsx`, `StatusBadge.tsx` — imports from `@/api/types` instead of `@/data/meetings`
- Rewrote `MeetingsIndex.tsx` — real data via useMeetings(), loading skeleton (5 rows), error state, Sync Krisp with real mutation + job polling, toast notifications, search filtering by title + attendee name, Triage tab, correct action buttons per status
- Rewrote `MeetingDetail.tsx` — useMeeting(slug) + useMeetings() for navigation; per-item PATCH on status/text change; Save & Approve calls POST /approve; SSE stream modal with live EventSource output; confirmation dialog on "Next" if pending review; approved/processing states; toast notifications throughout
- Created `src/test/hooks/useMeetings.test.tsx` — 13 tests covering useMeetings (fetch, duration mapping, status normalization, initials computation, error), useApproveItem (PATCH endpoint, editedText, skipped status), useJobStatus (disabled when null, enabled with jobId, running status), useSyncKrisp (POST sync returns jobId)
- `src/data/meetings.ts` preserved (not deleted) — still available for testing utilities

**Files changed**: `src/api/types.ts` (new), `src/api/client.ts` (new), `src/api/meetings.ts` (new), `src/hooks/meetings.ts` (new), `src/test/hooks/useMeetings.test.tsx` (new), `AvatarStack.tsx` (import), `MetadataPanel.tsx` (import), `ReviewItems.tsx` (import), `StatusBadge.tsx` (import), `MeetingsIndex.tsx` (rewrite), `MeetingDetail.tsx` (rewrite)

**Quality checks**: typecheck ✓ | web tests ✓ (13/13) | root tests ✓ (1256/1258) | vite build ✓

**Reflection**: The biggest complexity was MeetingDetail — coordinating optimistic local state with TanStack Query invalidations, SSE cleanup, and navigation confirmation. The type-shape-mismatch-in-API-layer pattern was very effective: components stayed clean and the mapping is all in one place. The `staged_item_edits` frontmatter field wasn't documented in FullMeeting's TypeScript type but was accessible via `frontmatter: Record<string, unknown>` — worth documenting. Token estimate: ~18k tokens.

## Task 6 — Update process-meetings skill for staged output (2026-03-05)

**Status**: Complete | **Commit**: bff78ab

**What was done**:
- Updated `packages/runtime/skills/process-meetings/SKILL.md` to add staged output as the default behavior
- Added top-level summary distinguishing default (staged) vs `--commit` (legacy) modes
- Added `> Note for arete view users` callout near the top
- Updated Arguments section to document `--file`, `--commit`, and `--json` flags
- Replaced Step 4 with a bifurcated section covering both Staged Output Mode and Commit Mode, including: extraction guidance for ai_NNN/de_NNN/le_NNN IDs, exact section header format, frontmatter updates (status/processed_at), and the restriction against writing to `.arete/memory/items/` in staged mode
- Preserved people/entity resolution steps (Steps 2, 3, 5, 5.5) unchanged
- Updated summary step to report staged item counts in staged mode

**Files changed**:
- `packages/runtime/skills/process-meetings/SKILL.md` — updated (SKILL.md only, no TypeScript changes)

**Quality checks**: typecheck ✓ | tests ✓ (1256 passed, 2 skipped)

**Reflection**: Reading the existing SKILL.md first was essential — it showed the exact structure to preserve (numbered steps, pattern refs, PATTERNS.md links). The task prompt's exact format requirements (section headers, ID format, frontmatter keys) mapped directly to the SKILL.md additions. ~3K tokens.

## Task 7 — arete view CLI command (2026-03-05)

**Status**: Complete | **Commit**: 7d84b0a

**What was done**:
- Created `packages/cli/src/commands/view.ts` with `runView()` (injectable deps for testing) + `registerViewCommand()` (Commander registration)
- `ViewCommandDeps` exports: `spawnFn`, `openBrowserFn`, `fetchFn`, `isPortAvailableFn` — all injectable for tests
- Port resolution: explicit `--port`/`PORT` env first; auto-select 3847→3848→3849 otherwise; clear error if all busy
- Spawns backend via `getPackageRoot()` + dev/prod fallback (`existsSync(backendDist)` → tsx or node)
- Polls GET /health 10×500ms (5s max); kills child and exits on timeout
- Platform-appropriate browser open (darwin/win32/linux) via `exec`
- SIGINT handler kills child with SIGTERM before exit
- `--json` flag on all error paths
- Registered `registerViewCommand` in `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- Created `packages/cli/test/commands/view.test.ts` — 6 tests: workspace-not-found (text + JSON), all-ports-busy (text + JSON), server-start-success (spawn + browser + ready message), SIGINT cleanup

**Files changed**:
- `packages/cli/src/commands/view.ts` — new
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts` — added import + registration
- `packages/cli/test/commands/view.test.ts` — new (6 tests)

**Quality checks**: typecheck ✓ | tests ✓ (1262 passed, 2 skipped)

**Reflection**: LEARNINGS.md patterns guided the DI design directly — the "HTTP server tests cause test runner hangs" gotcha made the injectable `isPortAvailableFn` essential to avoid real port binding in tests. The most non-obvious invariant: `afterEach` must call `process.removeAllListeners('SIGINT')` or SIGINT listeners from the success test bleed into the cleanup test (first listener throws before second executes). ~5K tokens.
