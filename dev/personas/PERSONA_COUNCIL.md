# Persona Council

Three behavioral archetypes representing Arete GUIDE MODE end users. Used during BUILD MODE feature planning as a voice-of-the-customer check. Personas are hypothesis-based — see Evidence Policy below.

## Evidence Policy

Unsupported persona claims are assumptions, not facts. When voicing a persona reaction with no evidence backing it, flag it: "hypothesis — not validated." Empty Evidence sections mean the persona is entirely hypothesis-based; treat council output as directional only, not validated signal.

## The Harvester

Core job: Capture signal before it disappears.

Behavior: Discovers value reactively. Pastes a Slack conversation, Arete surfaces something useful, they're convinced. Will not proactively fill out context files. Stays entirely in conversational mode. Will never run a CLI command. They are mid-flow when they use Arete — a meeting is happening, a decision is being made, something needs capturing now.

Cares about: Speed of capture. Zero interruptions during input. Ambient intelligence that works without setup.

Doesn't care about: People mapping. Quarterly planning. System health. Memory hygiene. Long-term structure payoff.

Friction threshold: Very low. Any dialog box, confirmation step, or prompt for additional input during capture is a failure. If Arete asks them something mid-paste, they close the tab.

Representative voice:
- "I just needed to save that conversation, not map everyone in it."
- "Why is it asking me something? I'm in the middle of a meeting."
- "I'll set that up later." (they won't)

Risk: Underinvests in context setup, then blames Arete when output quality is low.

## The Architect

Core job: Build a system that compounds over time.

Behavior: Reads ONBOARDING.md end to end before starting. Fills out context files methodically. Uses project workflows — discovery, PRD, competitive analysis — as their primary home. Runs CLI commands manually. Sets up meeting templates. They approach Arete as infrastructure investment, not a tool to grab when needed.

Cares about: Coherence between context, people, projects, and memory. Traceability. The long-term payoff of structured investment. Knowing where a decision is stored and how to find it six months from now.

Doesn't care about: Speed shortcuts that sacrifice structure. They will tolerate friction if the payoff is explicit and real.

Friction threshold: High tolerance for visible friction. Hidden friction — things that don't do what they expect, or silent failures — is worse to them than visible setup cost. They want to know when something doesn't connect.

Representative voice:
- "Does this connect to the people system or is it isolated?"
- "Where does this decision get stored so I can find it later?"
- "I want to spend 10 minutes setting this up correctly."

Risk: Over-architects. Spends more time maintaining Arete than building product.

## The Preparer

Core job: Produce better artifacts faster.

Behavior: Uses Arete when they have something to produce — a PRD, a meeting brief, a competitive analysis. Output-driven. Won't maintain the planning system week-over-week. Comes to Arete with a concrete deliverable in mind and leaves when the artifact is done.

Cares about: Quality of output. Does the PRD Arete helps write feel meaningfully better than prompting Claude directly? Does the meeting brief actually surface the right context? If yes, they use it. If no, they don't.

Doesn't care about: People intelligence. Memory health. Planning hierarchy. If it doesn't show up in the final artifact, it doesn't matter.

Friction threshold: Medium. Will tolerate setup friction if it clearly and visibly improves the artifact. Won't tolerate friction that has no obvious output benefit.

Representative voice:
- "Is this going to make my PRD better or is it just overhead?"
- "I don't need to track who said what, I need a good brief."
- "If this doesn't feel different from just asking Claude, I'm not using it."

Risk: Churns if output quality isn't obviously differentiated from using Claude directly. Invisible infrastructure doesn't retain them.
