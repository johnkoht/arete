# Progress Log - onboarding-improvements

## Context
- PRD: dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/prd.md
- Child PRDs:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/child-onboarding-mvp.md
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/child-rapid-context-dump-mvp.md

- Task list: dev/autonomous/prd.json
- Branch target: feature/onboarding-improvements

## Execution Notes
- Sequence by dependency order and phase:
  1) Stream boundaries and baseline alignment

## 2026-02-18 Bootstrapping

- Archived previous completed PRD artifacts for plan-mode-ux to:
  - dev/autonomous/archive/2026-02-18-onboarding-improvements-bootstrap/
- Initialized onboarding-improvements prd.json and progress tracker.
- Created/validated plan + pre-mortem + umbrella PRD + 3 child PRDs.
- Pending: execution pre-mortem approval before task loop.

### Task 1 — Lock stream boundaries and ownership ✅
- Updated umbrella PRD with explicit Stream Ownership Table (v1).
- Added task-to-stream mapping rule (single primary stream requirement).
- Added independent ship constraints to prevent cross-stream coupling.
- Files changed:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/prd.md

### Task 2 — Finalize onboarding-mvp baseline + deltas ✅
- Added explicit Baseline + Deltas section to Stream A child PRD.
- Reinforced Path A website + context dump delta and Phase 1 scope boundary.
- Files changed:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/child-onboarding-mvp.md

### Task 3 — Specify Rapid Context Dump MVP interface ✅
- Added deterministic input fallback matrix (paste/folder/url/upload-optional).
- Added explicit consent + exclusion acceptance criterion.
- Files changed:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/child-rapid-context-dump-mvp.md

### Task 4 — Specify People Intelligence MVP foundations ✅
- Added explicit suggestion payload expectations (confidence + evidence + source pointers).
- Added confidence-threshold behavior to avoid forced classification.
- Files changed:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/child-people-intelligence-mvp.md

### Task 5 — Define lightweight cross-stream contracts ✅
- Added Contract v1 table with producer/consumer ownership and fallback behavior.
- Files changed:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/prd.md

### Task 6 — Define 3-phase delivery gates and independent ship checks ✅
- Added phase gate table with user-visible wins and independent ship checks.
- Files changed:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/prd.md

### Task 7 — Finalize KPI thresholds and kill criteria ✅
- Added numeric KPI thresholds and pause/kill triggers for each stream.
- Added measurement window cadence.
- Files changed:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/prd.md

### Task 8 — Execution handoff package ✅
- Added source plan link and explicit execution handoff checklist in umbrella PRD.
- Verified plan/review/pre-mortem/prd artifacts are linked and synchronized.
- Files changed:
  - dev/prds/onboarding-improvements/prd.md

### Validation ✅
- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm test` passed
