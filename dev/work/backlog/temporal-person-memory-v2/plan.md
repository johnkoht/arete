# Plan

1. Add person memory refresh service in core (recurring asks/concerns from meetings).
2. Add CLI command `arete people memory refresh`.
3. Add unit + CLI tests (core and cli packages).
4. Update process and prep skills to use person memory highlights.
5. Update guide/sources docs and rebuild AGENTS.
6. Run full quality gates and summarize outcomes.
