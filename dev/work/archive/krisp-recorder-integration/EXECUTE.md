/build
```

## Manual (fallback)

Execute the krisp-mcp-integration PRD. Load the execute-prd skill from `.pi/skills/execute-prd/SKILL.md`. The PRD is at `dev/work/plans/krisp-recorder-integration/prd.md` and the task list is at `dev/work/plans/krisp-recorder-integration/prd.json`. Run the full workflow: pre-mortem → task execution loop → holistic review.
