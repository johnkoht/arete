NOTE: This review was for the original large plan (pi-memory adoption).
The full review is preserved here for reference. Key insights that carry forward to the quick-wins plan:
- Risk 5 (LEARNINGS.md shallow content) still applies — explicit source file lists are critical
- Eng Lead's concern about APPEND_SYSTEM.md and dev.mdc having overlapping content — both need updating
- The observation that LEARNINGS.md is still "voluntary compliance" — the pi extension for auto-injection partially addresses this for collaboration.md but not for LEARNINGS.md
- No automated tests exist for rule/skill files — manual verification is the only gate
