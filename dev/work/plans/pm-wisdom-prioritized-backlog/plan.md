# PM Wisdom Prioritized Backlog

**Generated**: 2026-02-10  
**Source**: 78 deduplicated concepts from Phase A (articles) + Phase B (books)  
**Format**: Matches `skills-enhancement.md` structure

## Executive Summary

### Themes

**Status**: Top 25 high-priority **COMPLETE** (2026-02-10). Remaining 44 medium-priority **ON HOLD**.

The 78 concepts from PM wisdom literature cluster into four implementation themes:

1. **Frameworks** — Named methodologies (strategy kernel, DHM, SMT, JTBD, Build-Measure-Learn, Five dysfunctions, etc.) that give PMs shared vocabulary and structure.
2. **Anti-patterns** — "Do not" rules and guardrails (version two is a lie, splitting the baby, confirmation bias, Mom Test violations) that prevent common failures.
3. **Scaffolding** — Prompts, questions, and checklists ("What am I getting wrong?", light pre-mortem, "How can we do this in half the time?") that guide behavior.
4. **Examples** — Worked templates (job statement, proxy metrics checklist) that show what good looks like.

### Impact

- **High-impact concepts** improve decision quality and output rigor: review-step prompts, strategy kernel, Mom Test anti-patterns, light pre-mortem, shipping/time-value framing, devil's advocate, disagree-and-commit.
- **Medium-impact** concepts add depth: frameworks (7 Powers, DHM, JTBD), anti-patterns (splitting the baby, shallow alignment), scaffolding (calibrated questions, multiplier questions).
- **Lower-impact** concepts are nice-to-have: peak-end rule, write well, some psychological biases when already covered by broader patterns.

### Distribution (Pareto Target)

- **High priority (top 25)**: ~20% — High impact + Low/Medium effort; do first
- **Medium priority (26–55)**: ~40% — Medium impact or Medium effort
- **Lower priority (56–78)**: ~40% — Lower impact or higher effort; backlog for later phases

## Suggested Implementation Path

- **Phase 1**: Items 1–15 (create-prd, discovery, construct-roadmap, quarter-plan — high-impact scaffolding and anti-patterns)
- **Phase 2**: Items 16–30 (expand frameworks, goals-alignment, meeting-prep)
- **Phase 3**: Items 31–55 (competitive-analysis, discovery depth, meeting-prep patterns)
- **Phase 4**: Items 56+ (lower-priority frameworks, bias concepts, polish)
