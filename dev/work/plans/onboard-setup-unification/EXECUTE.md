# Execute onboard-setup-unification PRD

## Pi (preferred)

Open the plan in plan mode and use `/build`:

```
/plan open onboard-setup-unification
/build
```

## Manual (fallback)

Execute the onboard-setup-unification PRD. Load the execute-prd skill from `.pi/skills/execute-prd/SKILL.md`. The PRD is at `dev/work/plans/onboard-setup-unification/prd.md` and the task list is at `dev/work/plans/onboard-setup-unification/prd.json`. Run the full workflow: pre-mortem → task execution loop → holistic review.
