NOTE: This review was for the original large plan (pi-memory adoption).
The full review is preserved here for reference. Key insights that carry forward to the quick-wins plan:
- Phase 2 (LEARNINGS.md) was independently shippable — confirmed, this is now the quick-wins plan
- MEMORY.md user-level vs project-level concern — no longer applies since we're keeping memory in-repo
- capabilities.json should be checked for any platform behavior changes
- Builder review of LEARNINGS.md files must be an explicit gate, not a suggestion
- "Zero memory infrastructure code" is overstated — should be "dramatically reduced"
