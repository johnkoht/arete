NOTE: This pre-mortem was for the original large plan (pi-memory adoption). 
Most risks (1-4, 6-8) are specific to pi-memory and no longer apply to the quick-wins plan.
Risk 5 (LEARNINGS.md shallow content) still applies directly.
The engineering lead and orchestrator reviews also contain insights relevant to the quick-wins plan.
