# Agent Observations

> **Purpose**: Atomic facts I've noticed about how you work. These are discrete, timestamped observations that feed into the collaboration profile.

---

## How This Works

- Each observation is a single, specific fact
- Timestamped and traceable to a source
- No interpretation here - just facts
- Periodically synthesized into `summaries/collaboration.md`

---

## Writing Style

<!-- Observations about how you prefer written deliverables -->

---

## Working Patterns

<!-- Observations about how you like to collaborate -->

---

## Domain Emphasis

<!-- Things you consistently emphasize or care about -->

---

## Corrections

<!-- Things you've corrected me on - important context -->

---

## Process Preferences

<!-- How you prefer we work together -->

---

<!-- 
Example observations:

## Writing Style
- [2026-02-03] You removed passive voice from PRD intro → preference for direct, active language
- [2026-02-03] You added "Why now?" section → timing context matters to you

## Working Patterns
- [2026-02-03] You asked for options before I proceeded → prefer choice over prescription
- [2026-02-03] You stopped me mid-task to redirect → I should check in more frequently

## Domain Emphasis
- [2026-02-03] You added user quotes to every section → evidence-based framing preferred

## Corrections
- [2026-02-03] "Don't assume enterprise = large company" → SMB can be enterprise-grade
- [2026-02-03] Corrected my use of "users" → you prefer "customers" for B2B context

## Process Preferences
- [2026-02-03] "Always show me the plan before executing" → explicit confirmation preferred
- [2026-02-03] "Let's punt on that for now" → items go to scratchpad for later
