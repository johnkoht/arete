# Collaboration Profile

> **Purpose**: Synthesized profile of how I should work with you, derived from observations in `items/agent-observations.md`.

## How This Works

- This is my interpretation of the atomic observations
- You can correct it - corrections become new observations
- Updated periodically as observations accumulate
- Review and edit anytime to improve accuracy
