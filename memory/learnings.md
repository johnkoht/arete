Example:

### 2026-01-27: Users abandon onboarding at step 3

**Source**: onboarding-discovery project
**Insight**: 40% of users drop off at the "connect integrations" step. User interviews revealed this step feels like too much commitment before seeing value.
**Implications**: 
- Should make integrations optional during onboarding
- Need to show value before asking for setup effort
- Consider "try before you buy" approach for integrations
**Applied To**: 
- onboarding-redesign PRD (2026-02)
