## How This Works

When you sync meetings or other content, the agent extracts potential decisions and learnings. Depending on the sync type:

- **Focused syncs** (e.g., "pull my Fathom recordings") → Review items immediately
- **Bulk syncs** (e.g., seed-context, multi-source sync) → Items queue here for later review

### Processing the Queue

Say any of these to review:
- "Review pending items"
- "Process my review queue"
- "What's in my pending review?"

During **weekly planning**, the agent will also surface any pending items.

### What Happens After Review

- **Approved decisions** → Added to `memory/items/decisions.md`
- **Approved learnings** → Added to `memory/items/learnings.md`
- **Skipped items** → Removed from queue (not saved)
- **Edited items** → Saved with your modifications
