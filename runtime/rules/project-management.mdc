# Project Management

Projects are the primary unit of work in this PM workspace. Each project has a lifecycle and structure.

## Project Lifecycle

```
Create → Work → Synthesize → Finalize → Archive
```

1. **Create**: Start a new project with a clear goal
2. **Work**: Add inputs, iterate on drafts (messy is okay)
3. **Synthesize**: Pull learnings together, make decisions
4. **Finalize**: Review outputs, commit changes to context
5. **Archive**: Move to archive, log to memory

## Creating a New Project

When user wants to start new work:

1. Check if related project already exists in `projects/active/`
2. Create project folder: `projects/active/[project-name]/`
3. Create README.md with project details
4. Suggest appropriate template from `templates/projects/`
5. Create subfolders: `inputs/`, `working/`, `outputs/`. Optionally `prototypes/` when using the generate-prototype-prompt skill (Lovable prompt outputs).

### Project README Template

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

**Type**: [discovery | prd | competitive-analysis | strategy-review | roadmap | execution | measurement]
**Status**: Active | Finalizing | Archived
**Goal**: [What are we trying to achieve?]
**Started**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Target Completion**: YYYY-MM-DD (optional)

## Background
[Why are we doing this? What prompted it?]

## Key Questions
1. [Question to answer]
2. [Question to answer]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [How we know this is done]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome]

## Related Context
- [Link to relevant context files]
- [Link to related past projects]

## Status Updates
### YYYY-MM-DD
[Latest update on progress]
```

## Working Within a Project

### Adding Inputs
Drop raw materials into `inputs/`:
- Meeting notes
- User feedback
- Research findings
- Transcripts
- Screenshots/artifacts

Name files descriptively: `YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`

**After adding multiple inputs**: Suggest the user run `qmd update` to make new content searchable:
```
You've added several inputs. To make them searchable, run:
  qmd update
```

### Working Documents
Iterate freely in `working/`:
- Drafts
- Synthesis documents
- Analysis
- Scratch notes

These are works in progress—don't worry about polish.

### Outputs
Final deliverables go in `outputs/`:
- Completed PRDs
- Final analyses
- Recommendations
- Presentations

### Prototypes (optional)
When using the **generate-prototype-prompt** skill, Lovable prompt outputs go in `prototypes/`:
- `prototypes/YYYY-MM-DD_[feature-slug]/` — dated folder per generation
- Contains `knowledge.md`, `implementation.md`, and `README.md` for pasting into [Lovable](https://lovable.dev)

## Project Status Updates

Update the README.md status section when:
- Major progress is made
- Blockers are encountered
- Scope changes
- Key decisions are made

## Concurrent Projects

The workspace supports 2-3 active projects. If user tries to start more:
1. Review existing active projects
2. Suggest prioritization
3. Consider if one can be paused or finalized

## Finalizing a Project

When a project is ready to complete (use `finalize-project.mdc`):

1. **Review outputs**: Confirm deliverables are complete
2. **Identify context updates**: What should update core context?
3. **Archive old context**: Save previous versions to `context/_history/`
4. **Update context**: Apply changes to context files
5. **Log decisions/learnings**: Capture in memory
6. **Update status**: Mark as "Archived" in README
7. **Move project**: `projects/active/` → `projects/archive/YYYY-MM_[name]/`

## Project Naming

Use kebab-case with descriptive names:
- `onboarding-discovery`
- `checkout-prd`
- `q1-competitive-analysis`
- `2026-roadmap-planning`
