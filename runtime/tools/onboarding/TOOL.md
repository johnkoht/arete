# Onboarding Tool

A structured approach to starting a new job with excellence. This tool helps you move from newcomer to established contributor through three phases: Learn, Contribute, and Lead. It's designed to help you build genuine understanding, establish credibility, form real relationships, and set yourself up for long-term success.

> **Areté in Action**: The goal isn't just to survive onboarding—it's to thrive. This tool helps you pursue excellence from day one.

## When to Use

- "I'm starting a new job"
- "Start onboarding tool"
- "Help me with my 30/60/90 day plan"
- "I want to onboard effectively"
- "New role, help me ramp up"

## When NOT to Use

- You've been in the role for 90+ days already
- You're doing a lateral move within the same team
- You just need a quick checklist (use a simple task list instead)

## Scope Options

### Comprehensive (Default)

Full 90-day structured onboarding with deep context-building.

- Complete 30/60/90 day plan with detailed first 30 days
- Weekly planning and check-ins
- Full context file population
- Stakeholder mapping and relationship building
- 1:1 tracking and synthesis
- Documented wins and learnings

**Best for**: New company, new domain, leadership roles, or when you want maximum support.

### Streamlined

Focused 30-day plan with essential tracking.

- 30-day detailed plan only
- Bi-weekly check-ins
- Core context files only (business overview, products, users)
- Key stakeholder identification
- Light 1:1 tracking

**Best for**: Similar domain, familiar company type, or when you're already confident in your onboarding abilities.

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Learn (Days 1-30)

**Goal**: Build deep understanding of the business, product, users, and team

**Mindset**: Curiosity over contribution. Your job is to absorb, not to fix.

#### Two Traps to Avoid

Before diving into activities, be aware of two common pitfalls:

1. **The Documentation Hole**: Spending weeks reading documentation without talking to people. Context lives in conversations, not wikis. Documentation is a starting point, not the full picture. Balance reading with relationship-building from day one.

2. **Coming In Hot**: Proposing solutions in weeks 1-2 before you understand the problem space. Resist the urge to "add value" through suggestions too early. Your fresh perspective is valuable, but only after you've earned the context to wield it effectively.

#### Key Activities

- [ ] Schedule **walking 1:1s** (not sitting ones) with key stakeholders (manager, peers, cross-functional partners)
- [ ] Use **The 9 Magic Words** in every 1:1: "What can I do to make your life easier?" — This opens doors and builds relationships faster than any other question
- [ ] Ask your manager, eng lead, and design lead: **"Is there a burning problem I can investigate and diagnose?"** (not solve) — Aim for 2-3 problems to deeply understand
- [ ] Read all available documentation (PRDs, strategy docs, wikis) — but don't fall into the documentation hole
- [ ] Shadow customer calls or review recordings
- [ ] Understand the product deeply (use it, break it, question it)
- [ ] Map the organization and decision-making processes
- [ ] Identify the "unwritten rules" and cultural norms
- [ ] **Document as you learn** — Create data dictionaries, process maps, and guides as you understand them. Triple benefit: deepens your learning, creates a reference for your future self, and provides leverage for the team

#### Breadth Over Depth

During your first 30 days, resist the temptation to dive deep into rabbit holes. You have a **fresh eyes window** — a limited time when your beginner's mind reveals opportunities, dysfunctions, and questions that others have stopped seeing. Use this window wisely:

- **Survey broadly before specializing** — Touch every part of the business, product, and team before deep-diving any one area
- **Capture fresh observations** — Write down what surprises you, what seems obvious but isn't documented, what feels harder than it should be
- **"Because vs Despite" lens** — Businesses thrive **despite** problems, not because everything is perfect. Observe what's working and why, not just what's broken. This lens helps you choose your battles wisely.

**Questions to Answer**:
- What problem does the company solve? For whom?
- What's the business model? How does money flow?
- Who are the key customers/users? What do they care about?
- What's the product strategy? Where is it headed?
- Who are the key people I need relationships with?
- What are the current priorities and why?
- What's working well? What's not?

**Outputs**:
- Draft context files (business overview, products, users, competitive landscape)
- Stakeholder map with relationship status
- List of open questions to resolve
- Initial observations and insights

**Phase Complete When**:
- You can explain the business to someone new
- You've met with all key stakeholders at least once
- Draft context files exist for core areas
- You have a clear picture of current priorities
- **You've held a situational conversation with your manager** — You can play back what you've learned and validate your understanding ("Here's what I understand about our strategy/customers/priorities. What am I missing?")

---

### Phase 2: Contribute (Days 31-60)

**Goal**: Start adding value while continuing to deepen understanding

**Mindset**: Helpful contributor. Look for ways to add value without overreaching.

#### Quick Win Finder

Your first 30 days built understanding. Now it's time to prove you can deliver. Quick wins are the bridge between observation and ownership—they build your trust battery and earn you credibility for bigger initiatives.

**What makes a good quick win?**

- **Fast**: Completable in 2-3 weeks (not months)
- **Visible**: Others see the impact (not invisible infrastructure)
- **Low-risk**: Won't break critical systems if you're still learning
- **Unowned**: Nobody else is already working on it (unclaimed territory)

**Why quick wins matter**: Every small commitment you deliver charges your trust battery. Quick wins prove competence, demonstrate your ability to ship, and earn you the credibility to tackle bigger problems later. They're not just tasks—they're trust-building exercises.

**Tactical Quick Win Examples**:

- **Demo the product internally** — Build a presentation or workshop that showcases the product to new employees or other teams. Proves you understand it deeply by weeks 4-6.
- **Run a retro on a recent release** — Your outsider perspective is an asset here. Ask the "dumb" questions about what worked and what didn't. Team gets insights, you get context.
- **Fix a small visible problem hiding in plain sight** — That annoying onboarding flow bug? The confusing error message? The outdated screenshot in docs? Small fixes with visible impact.
- **Audit an existing workflow for low-hanging fruit** — Review a conversion funnel, user onboarding flow, or internal process. Identify 3-5 quick improvements with minimal engineering lift.
- **Create or improve a recurring artifact** — Design a better template for PRDs, status updates, roadmap formats, or sprint planning. Something the team will use repeatedly.

#### Trust Battery

Trust isn't binary—it's not "trusted" vs "untrusted." It's a battery that charges (or drains) with every interaction. You start your new role with a neutral battery. Every commitment kept, every deadline met, every "I'll follow up" that actually gets followed up—these charge the battery. Every missed commitment, every overpromise, every "I'll get back to you" that never happens—these drain it.

**How to charge your trust battery:**

- **Make small commitments and keep them** — "I'll send you that doc by Friday" → send it Thursday. Trust grows through consistency, not grand gestures.
- **Track your Say/Do Ratio** — What you say you'll do vs what you actually do. A 100% Say/Do Ratio is the fastest way to build credibility. Keep a running list in your notes: commitments made → commitments delivered.
- **Make progress visible** — Share what you're working on, even if it's not done. "Here's what I'm thinking so far" invites feedback and shows you're moving forward.
- **Deliver incrementally** — Don't disappear for 3 weeks and emerge with a finished artifact. Share drafts early, get feedback often, iterate publicly.

#### Navigating Imposter Syndrome

If you're feeling some version of "I don't know what I'm doing" or "They're going to figure out I don't belong here"—welcome to the club. Imposter syndrome is nearly universal in new roles, especially high-performing ones. Here's the truth: your fresh perspective is valuable, not a liability.

You're not supposed to know everything yet. You're 30-60 days in. What you're supposed to do is:
- Ask good questions (you're doing this)
- Learn quickly (you're doing this)
- Deliver on small commitments (this is what Phase 2 is for)
- Show up consistently (keep showing up)

Focus on contribution, not perfection. Nobody expects you to be the expert yet. They expect you to be curious, reliable, and helpful. You're already doing the work—now give yourself permission to be a beginner who's learning fast.

**Key Activities**:
- [ ] Join active projects in a supporting role
- [ ] Take on small, well-scoped tasks and deliver them well
- [ ] Deepen relationships with key stakeholders (second 1:1s)
- [ ] Start sharing observations and asking strategic questions
- [ ] Identify one area where you can make a meaningful contribution
- [ ] Refine context files based on deeper understanding
- [ ] Document your first "win" (however small)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Where can I add the most value given my skills?
- What problems exist that I'm uniquely positioned to help with?
- Who are my allies and potential collaborators?
- What does success look like in this role?
- What are the unstated expectations?

**Outputs**:
- At least one documented win/contribution
- Refined context files
- Deeper stakeholder relationships
- Identified opportunity area for Phase 3

**Phase Complete When**:
- You've delivered at least one meaningful contribution
- Key stakeholders see you as helpful and competent
- You have a clear target for what you'll own in Phase 3
- Context files are mostly complete

---

### Phase 3: Lead (Days 61-90)

**Goal**: Own something meaningful and establish your presence

**Mindset**: Confident owner. You've earned the right to lead.

**Key Activities**:
- [ ] Lead a project or initiative (not just support)
- [ ] Propose ideas and improvements based on your learnings
- [ ] Mentor or help others (share what you've learned)
- [ ] Establish yourself as the "go-to" for your area
- [ ] Build cross-functional relationships beyond your immediate team
- [ ] Finalize all context files
- [ ] Begin thinking beyond onboarding—what's your 6-month vision?

**Questions to Answer**:
- What do I want to be known for?
- What's my unique contribution to this team?
- Where do I see opportunities others might miss?
- What relationships do I need to invest in long-term?

**Outputs**:
- Led initiative with documented outcomes
- Complete, accurate context files
- Established reputation and relationships
- Clear vision for post-onboarding focus

**Phase Complete When**:
- You've successfully led at least one initiative
- People seek you out for your expertise
- Context files are complete and accurate
- You feel confident operating independently

### Key Principles

1. **Listen more than you talk** (especially in Phase 1)
2. **Build relationships before you need them**
3. **Small wins create momentum** (don't wait for the big project)
4. **Ask "dumb" questions early** (it gets harder later)
5. **Document as you learn** (your future self will thank you)
6. **Understand before you optimize** (resist the urge to fix things immediately)
