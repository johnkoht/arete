# This skill was replaced

**generate-mockup** has been replaced by **generate-prototype-prompt**.

- **New skill:** `.agents/skills/generate-prototype-prompt/SKILL.md`
- **What it does:** Generates a Lovable-ready Knowledge file and implementation prompt from a PRD, plan, or conversation. You paste both into [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) to build the prototype. No MCP required.

To use the new skill, ask: "Generate a prototype prompt" or "Create a prompt for Lovable from this PRD."
