# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Wiki-leaning meeting extraction** — when topics are detected on a transcript, the LLM sees existing topic-page sections + topic-tagged L2 items as "already known" and emits only deltas (new decisions, changed plans, new risks/questions). Verbatim delta directive includes a "When in doubt, INCLUDE" tiebreaker and a one-shot CONFIRMATION-of-uncertainty example. Char budget guard (`MAX_TOPIC_WIKI_CONTEXT_CHARS = 6000`) with 3-tier truncation; highest-scored topic never dropped.
- **Recap reshape** — extraction now produces `## Core` (free-form, principle-based — what's actionable/decided/changed) and `## Could include` (≤8 prioritized one-line headlines for side threads). `## Summary` retained for backward compat; both headings parse permanently. Production parsers (`apps/backend/src/routes/intelligence.ts`, `services/workspace.ts`, `services/patterns.ts`) updated to dual-anchor `/^##\s+(?:Summary|Core)\s*$/m`.
- **Topic detection** — new `detectTopicsLexical` / `detectTopicsLexicalDetailed` services with stop-token list (10 generic words: planning, review, sync, discussion, meeting, update, status, team, weekly, daily) and ≥2 non-stop slug tokens + ≥0.5 coverage threshold. Cap at 3 candidates at rollout.
- **L2 topic tags** — `learnings.md` and `decisions.md` entries gain `**Topics**: slug-a, slug-b` bullet for per-topic queryability. New `getMemoryItemsForTopics(paths, slugs, opts)` helper. Memory parser (`parseMemorySections`) now matches all three header shapes (`## Title`, `### YYYY-MM-DD: Title`, `### Title`) via single-pass classifier with priority order + code-fence tracking.
- **CLI tuning lever** — `arete meeting extract --dry-run-topics` runs detection only, prints score + matched tokens (separated stop vs non-stop) + last_refreshed for each detected slug; supports `--json`. Used to tune detection thresholds against real meetings before A/B rollout.
- **Frontmatter sanitizer** — `stripYamlDocSeparator` strips line-start `---` from LLM-generated `core` and `could_include[]` strings before they're written into staged sections of YAML-frontmattered meeting files. Strip-and-warn pattern (deliberately diverged from topic-memory.ts's drop-on-detect: LLM prose is more likely accidental than malicious).

### Fixed
- **L2 parser/writer mismatch** — newly written learnings/decisions were unsearchable because writer emitted `## Title` while parser only matched `### Title`. Parser now matches all three header shapes.
- **Backend missing `activeTopicSlugs`** — CLI passed it to `extractMeetingIntelligence`; backend silently skipped, producing different extractions on the web path. Backend now mirrors CLI's assembly via `loadMemorySummary` + `renderActiveTopicsAsSlugList`.
- **`updateMeetingContent` anchor bug** — anchor regex looked for `## Summary` only; on files with `## Core` (post-rollout), would fail to anchor and APPEND new content rather than REPLACE, duplicating staged sections on re-extraction. Now dual-anchor.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Meeting extraction fragmentation** — tightened `buildMeetingExtractionPrompt()` with a new Consolidation section that teaches the model to emit ONE action item per unit of work. Three named patterns now handled inline: handoff chain (A identifies → B agrees → C picks up = one item owned by the last person), collaborative-initiative split (pilot with multiple contributors = one item for the outcome, not one per sub-task), and same-outcome-different-verbs. Enabling sub-tasks ("get access", "provision Y", "send test data") now fold into the parent initiative rather than emitting as separate items. Speculation framing ("I wonder if…", "Maybe we try…") caps confidence at 0.5 instead of being elevated to commitments.
- Verified against two real meetings at frontier tier: a Claude damage-estimation pilot collapsed from 7 action items to 3 (one consolidated pilot item), and a handoff chain on a state case-sensitivity bug correctly collapsed to a single item owned by the person who picked up the work.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Brief AI synthesis** — `arete brief --for "topic"` now produces concise 5-section AI-synthesized briefings (Current Status, Key Decisions, Key People, Recent Activity, Open Questions/Risks) instead of raw markdown dumps. Three modes: AI synthesis (default), raw fallback (AI not configured), explicit `--raw` flag
- `SynthesizedBriefing` type and `'brief'` AITask with standard tier routing
- `synthesizeBriefing()` method on IntelligenceService with method-parameter DI for AIService
- 12K character context truncation ceiling for AI synthesis
- **Getting-started web research** — onboarding skill now proactively researches the user's company via WebSearch/WebFetch before asking questions, replacing generic Q&A with an informed conversation
- 8-phase getting-started flow: profile check, consent, web research, present findings, targeted conversation, draft & review, integration scavenge, first win, graduation
- Graceful degradation ladder for web research failures
- 15 new tests (7 core synthesis + 8 CLI brief command)

### Fixed
- **SPA fallback on POST requests** — `serveStatic` middleware no longer serves `index.html` for POST/PUT/DELETE API calls, fixing "Unexpected token '<'" JSON parse errors when dismissing meetings

### Changed
- Brief JSON output now includes `synthesized`, `truncated`, `synthesis`, and `raw` fields (replaces `markdown`)
- Getting-started onboarding time updated from 15-30 to 30-45 minutes to reflect web research phase

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Extraction intelligence** — two-layer dedup architecture reducing ~40% decision/learning duplication in meeting extraction: prompt-level hardening (self-review instructions, exclusion lists, confidence guides, trivial/garbage filters) + post-reconciliation `batchLLMReview()` for semantic dedup against committed memory items
- Real confidence scores from extraction (no longer hardcoded 0.9)
- Prior meeting items fed into extraction prompts for cross-meeting context
- Prompt injection mitigations in `batchLLMReview` (input sanitization, ID validation)
- **Slack digest skill** — daily/weekly winddown integration for Slack channel summaries
- **Commitments create CLI** — `arete commitments create` for manual commitment entry
- **Workspace hygiene** — `arete hygiene scan` and `arete hygiene apply` for detecting and cleaning workspace entropy (Phase 1)

- **Krisp OAuth redirect URI** — corrected redirect URI for OAuth flow
- **Weekly-winddown alignment** — aligned with daily meeting processing pipeline
- **Direction-inversion bugs** — fixed ours/theirs direction swap in extraction pipeline

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Meeting dismiss** — skip/unskip meetings from triage (`arete meeting dismiss`)

### Fixed

### Added
- **Google Workspace integration** (`gws` CLI) — Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and People access via `arete gws <resource>`
- **GWS detection** — auto-detects Google Workspace availability at startup; registers in integration registry
- **Jaccard deduplication** — `TaskService.addTask()` checks for near-duplicate tasks (≥80% similarity or matching commitment link) before inserting; idempotent writes across repeated skill runs
- **Meeting context injection** — daily-plan and week-plan skills read open tasks from `week.md`/`tasks.md` before proposing new work; prevents re-proposing already-captured items
- **Approve High Confidence** — one-click approval for all Review items at or above a configurable confidence threshold (default 80%)
- **Approve by Meeting** — Review items grouped by source meeting; approve or skip an entire meeting's items at once
- **Auto-approve preview banner** — amber banner surfaces when all items in a meeting exceed 0.8 confidence; nothing auto-approved silently
- **Review summary** — post-approval summary shows approved/skipped/undecided counts and lists auto-approved items for audit
- **Area-focused week planning** — week-plan skill opens by asking which areas to focus on, then scopes goals and projects to those areas

### Changed

- **Recon check** — formal CONFIRMED/PHANTOM/PARTIAL classification in execute-prd Phase 0
- **prd-post-mortem** — 9→5 sections; Signal Patterns section; synthesize-collaboration-profile mandatory
- **Reviewer mindset** — grumpy-by-default ("assume something is wrong until proven otherwise")
- **synthesize-collaboration-profile** — triggers simplified: automatic after post-mortem + on-request only
- **Multi-phase ship** — meta-orchestrator loop with phase gates, GATE_PASS/GATE_FAIL escalation, project-working-memory.md
- **Reconciliation threshold** — raised from 0.5 → 0.65; lower-confidence items filtered earlier, reducing review queue noise
- **Goal/project hierarchy** — quarter-plan prompts for area on goal creation; general-project prompts for linked goal
