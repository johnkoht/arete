**Type**: Discovery
**Status**: Active
**Goal**: Understand and address onboarding drop-off, especially at step 3 and admin setup
**Started**: 2026-01-15
**Target Completion**: 2026-02-28

## Background

User research and support tickets indicate friction in onboarding. Step 3 and admin configuration are common drop-off points. This discovery informs onboarding v2 scope.

## Key Questions

1. Why do users stall at step 3?
2. What makes admin setup confusing?
3. What in-app guidance would help most?

## Hypotheses to Test

| Hypothesis | Confidence | How We'll Test |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Step 3 is too complex | Medium | User interviews, analytics |
| Admin docs are unclear | High | Support ticket review, customer feedback |
| In-app guidance > external docs | Medium | User interviews |
