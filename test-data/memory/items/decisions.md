### 2026-02-04: Proceed with onboarding v2 scope
**Project**: onboarding-discovery
**Context**: Product Review meeting; timeline pressure vs scope
**Decision**: Proceed with onboarding v2 scope as defined; no scope reduction for timeline
**Rationale**: User research strongly supports step 3 and admin improvements; deferring would extend pain for new users
**Alternatives Considered**: Reduce scope (defer admin), push timeline
**Status**: Active

### 2026-02-01: Defer design system refresh
**Project**: Sprint Planning
**Context**: Sprint capacity; onboarding v2 vs design system refresh
**Decision**: Defer design system refresh to next sprint to protect onboarding timeline
**Rationale**: Onboarding directly impacts north star (activation); design system is important but not blocking
**Alternatives Considered**: Parallel work, partial refresh
**Status**: Active
