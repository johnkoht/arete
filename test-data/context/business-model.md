# Business Model

## Revenue Streams

- Annual SaaS subscriptions (core product)
- Add-on seats for cross-functional collaborators
- Premium support package for enterprise accounts

## Pricing Approach

- Tiered by team size and feature set
- Annual contracts with optional quarterly business review support

## Key Economics

- Primary growth lever: activation to retained account conversion
- Key risk: support-heavy onboarding for larger customers
- Expansion trigger: additional teams onboarded inside an existing account
