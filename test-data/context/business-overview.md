# Business Overview

## Company

Areté is a product builder operating system for PMs and product leaders at growth-stage B2B SaaS companies.

## Problem Space

Product context is fragmented across docs, meetings, chat, and spreadsheets. Teams lose historical decisions and repeatedly rediscover prior work.

## Why Now

AI-assisted workflows are only useful when they are grounded in accurate business context and recent operating signals.

## Strategic Focus (Current Quarter)

- Improve onboarding activation outcomes
- Tighten customer feedback loops into product planning
- Increase confidence and speed in weekly PM execution
